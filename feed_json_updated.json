As I was too low on energy for Practialli work, I did lots of chores instead. I had more energy later in the week.</p>\n<p>I received a puncture on the Sunday ride which was the first in about 5 years.  It was relatively quick to change even though it was rear tire.  I brought the punctured inner tube back home and repaired it with a patch.</p>\n<p>Examining the rear tire it had quite a lot of damage, several significant holes and the surface was starting to bubble slightly.  Although it has some life left it is time to swap it over for a new(ish) tire, a Continential Duraskin that I have had for quite a while but looks like new.  It should be very durable and hopefully puncture free for another 5 years.</p>\n<p>I will use the worn tire for the indoor trainer machine.</p>\n<p>A search showed me how to correctly create <a href=\"#markdown\">Markdown comments</a> which are supported by todo comments.  The todo comments help me track work that needs to be done within markdown files.</p>\n<p>Started watching <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch\">Star Wars The Bad Bad</a>{target=_blank} animated series from scratch as I hadn't seen it for a while and I hadn't seen season 3 at all yet.  Season 3 is the final one for this show.  I really like this show as it has some interesting characters and stories.  The storyline starts where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)\">Star Wars The Clone Wars</a> animated series finishes, from the issue of Oder 66 that brings the Jedi order to an end.</p>\n<p>My Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds died last week.  The left earbud is now flashing red and white which means it cant connect the right eadbud (the main controller).  I've tried rebooting it several times but without success.</p>\n<p>Bose support will offer me a small discount (189.99 instead of 219.99 on Amazon) on the Bose Quiet Elite earbuds if I send my faulty earbuds back.  However this apparently takes about a month to confirm I've sent the faulty earbuds back before Bose would send the new earbuds.  Not a nice experience having to wait that long.</p>\n<p>I do have some smaller Bose earbuds that work pretty well.  I may shop around and probably try the Sony earbuds next time to see if they last longer.</p>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/may/26.png", "date_modified": "2025-05-31T16:53:27+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["clojure", "markdown", "neovim", "practicalli", "squirrel-squadron"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/neovim-life/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/neovim-life/", "title": "Neovim Life", "content_html": "<p>I have been very busy working on the <a href=\"https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5\">Practicalli Astro 5 config</a> so I havent been updating this journal as often.

Unfortunately the follow-on interview with two developers when very poorly as they seemed to be interviewing me for a very different role.</p>\n<p>The developers didn't seem at all prepared and were 'trying something different' apparently.</p>\n<p>We started with what they called a 'pairing session' where they handed my a laptop (it was a Mac and I had not used one in a long time).  I struggled to use the mouse to click and the developers couldn't (be bothered to) explain how they had set it up.  I muddled on...</p>\n<p>The 'pairing' continued where I struggled to use the Mac and IntelliJ (something else I hadn't used) to try understand a code base using libraries I had never used.  I asked questions about the code but the developers refused to answer them, saying I should just experiment with the code.</p>\n<p>As I couldn't figure out how the Clojure REPL worked in IntelliJ and they didn't know either, my ability to experiment was severely limited.  It wasn't even clear how to start the application so I could see it running or run any unit tests.  The developers just stat there and watched the screen or stared at me, without answering any questions.</p>\n<p>By this time I was becoming quite disillusioned with the developers in front of me.  I was trying not to focus on the question of why I wanted to work with people so closed as this.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that neither of the developers interviewing me were playing their part in the 'pairing' process and watched me struggle instead.  Actually one of the developers was feeling so out of their depth that they didn't really engage in any part of the interview, except to say that they were feeling out of their depth when I did ask about their role during our brief introductions.</p>\n<p>After 30 minutes of not 'pairing' with me, they proceeded to quiz me on obscure information about REST.  One of the developers took great pride in how much they had learned about REST, the four levels of REST and lots of other niche information.  This seemed to be the measure of how good an engineer would be, mainly because that is how his previous (and only) tech lead had worked.</p>\n<p>I walked out of the interview at the end with the final words that they should talk to their founder about what they are looking for, to save everyone some time.  I had no illusions that any kind of follow-up from the interview would be forth-coming.  I was pleased not to have to even consider a role there.</p>\n<p>Its not the first time (probably no the last) that people within a company have wildly different expectations.
