An interesting thing I saw when signing up for an account was that 1Password first did a credit card check by trying to take 1 USD from my account.  As the account was empty then my bank refused the withdrawal.  So 1Password asked for $0 dollars instead, which my bank app prompted me to accept.  I have 7 days trial to change my mind before they take the annual payment (32 Euros).</p>\n<p>Started the <a href=\"https://practical.li/rust\">Practicalli Rust book</a>{target=_blank} although this is only the structure of the book and the CI publishing workflow for the moment.

Unfortunately the follow-on interview with two developers when very poorly as they seemed to be interviewing me for a very different role.</p>\n<p>The developers didn't seem at all prepared and were 'trying something different' apparently.</p>\n<p>We started with what they called a 'pairing session' where they handed my a laptop (it was a Mac and I had not used one in a long time).  I struggled to use the mouse to click and the developers couldn't (be bothered to) explain how they had set it up.  I muddled on...</p>\n<p>The 'pairing' continued where I struggled to use the Mac and IntelliJ (something else I hadn't used) to try understand a code base using libraries I had never used.  I asked questions about the code but the developers refused to answer them, saying I should just experiment with the code.</p>\n<p>As I couldn't figure out how the Clojure REPL worked in IntelliJ and they didn't know either, my ability to experiment was severely limited.  It wasn't even clear how to start the application so I could see it running or run any unit tests.  The developers just stat there and watched the screen or stared at me, without answering any questions.</p>\n<p>By this time I was becoming quite disillusioned with the developers in front of me.  I was trying not to focus on the question of why I wanted to work with people so closed as this.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that neither of the developers interviewing me were playing their part in the 'pairing' process and watched me struggle instead.  Actually one of the developers was feeling so out of their depth that they didn't really engage in any part of the interview, except to say that they were feeling out of their depth when I did ask about their role during our brief introductions.</p>\n<p>After 30 minutes of not 'pairing' with me, they proceeded to quiz me on obscure information about REST.  One of the developers took great pride in how much they had learned about REST, the four levels of REST and lots of other niche information.  This seemed to be the measure of how good an engineer would be, mainly because that is how his previous (and only) tech lead had worked.</p>\n<p>I walked out of the interview at the end with the final words that they should talk to their founder about what they are looking for, to save everyone some time.  I had no illusions that any kind of follow-up from the interview would be forth-coming.  I was pleased not to have to even consider a role there.</p>\n<p>Its not the first time (probably no the last) that people within a company have wildly different expectations.  Its like they haven't actually talked to each other about the role :shocked_face_with_exploding_head:</p>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/100-days-of-code/day-088.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-07T18:32:16+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["100daysofcode", "clojure"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/day-90---what-will-be-my-next-role/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/day-90---what-will-be-my-next-role/", "title": "Day 90 - What will be my next role", "content_html": "<p>Considering my options for my next role.
