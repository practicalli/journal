I am doing a big cycling challenge in Summer so January is the month to check I can still ride my bike and everything on the bike is running smoothly.

The number of days with nice weather for cycling may be few and far between this month.  Ideally the weather should be above 5 Celcius and dry conditions, especially for cycling around the Kent countryside.

I have been doing some post holidays shopping on line, mostly winter kit and improvements to the bicycle.

## Cycling

It was dry most of this week so I took the opportunity to test out the winter kit I acquired in December and hadn't had a chance to try.  I also received more kit during the week, so had a chance to try some alternative combinations.

The road into Otford has newly been resurfaced, so I did all the weekday rides down to Otford.  The new road surface is so good to ride on and much easier on the assent back up out of Otford.
