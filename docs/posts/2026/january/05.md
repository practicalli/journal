The United Kingdom is feeling the force of the arctic thats to high pressure subsuming the gulf stream.  This week will be very cold with ice around on roads and paths.

Walking will continue to be the main exercise until the weather is more conducive to cycling.

Started planning for the Dragon Ride event in summer.  I've ordered new jockey wheels to make the chain run very smooth, a smaller saddle bag, a lighter light and some cycling kit to keep me warm on colder rides.

## Cycling

The winter sales are an opportunity to refresh my cycling kit, especially as some of my kit is feeling a little loose.  Most of the kit is 5 years old and some is 10 years or more.

As I continue to loose weigh and be more cyclist shape then some of my bib shorts feel a little loose, not quite as comfortable as they used to be.

### SpatzWear

I have really loved wearing Spatzwear base layers and their all-season jersey. The base layer and jersey are both designed to be figure hugging, minimising wrinkles that cause drag and reduce watts (1 watt per wrinkle).  The Jersy is warm enough by itself until the temperature gets below 10 Celsius, when a jacket over the top is needed.

Early in December 2025 I ordered a [POLAR LAYER fleece gilet](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/polar-layer-base-layer){target=_blank} that is very toasty and will fit under the all sesons jersey, minimising the need for a jacket on very colde days. Adding SpatzWear arm warmers under the jersey should keep me warm down to 5 Celcius.

I also got the [GLOVZ Race Gloves with fold-out wind blocking shell](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-glovz-race-gloves-with-hidden-wind-blocking-layer-glovz){target=_blank} that should be okay down to 5 Celcius.

Other items I am considering to add to the winter kit include:

- [BURNR 4 season Arm Warmers](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-burnr-4-season-arm-warmers-burnr){target=_blank}
- [BURNR 4 season Leg Warmers](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-burnr-4-season-leg-warmers){target=_blank}
- [HOTSOKZ Long Winter Merino Socks](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/hotsokz){target=_blank}
- [Windsock2 UCI Legal Aero Oversocks](){target=_blank}

Spatzwear are giving away a pair of their [Shield Glas)es](https://www.spatzwear.com/products/spatz-shield-glasses-translucent-pink-shield){target=_blank} with orders over 100 GBP throughout January.


### Lusso

I've recently seen adverts for a Manchester based cycling company that makes well regarded cycling kit.  They have a winter sale so I've ordered some bib shorts and socks.

They have a very nice looking plum coloured bib shorts, made from recycled materials.

The socks look very toasty too.
