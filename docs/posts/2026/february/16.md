I am reviewing the Practicalli web sites and issues already created to find the most useful things to work on.

Continuing to add [Terminal UI (TUI) apps](#tui) to my development environment.  Adding those I find useful to the [dev tools install script for Debian Linux](#software-development-tools).

This week I noticed that Node.js website has a configurable script for [installing Node.js (and NPM)](#nodejs).  I took this script and tweaked it so it supports both `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and classic `$HOME` installs.

I have been trying out different [desktop greeters](#desktop-display-manager), the tool that presents a graphical login.  Gnome edition of Debian Linux comes with Gnome Desktop Manager (gdm).  I switched to [LightDM](#lightdm) which uses far fewer resources and has a nice [Arctica theme](#lightdm-themes).

<!-- more -->


## TUI

Evaluating more TUI apps for software development and writing content.  This week I've been running Lychee to check the Practicalli websites.

Lychee is also included in the Megalinter config which runs as a CI workflow for each push or pull request to a Practicalli Website.

I can run Megalinter locally, but that requires Docker and I only use that as a background check infrequently.

Lychee should encourage me to check a published website more often, especially if I make some changes or it has been a while since I reviewed a website.


### Lychee hyperlink checker

A Command line tool to check the hyperlinks in a website.

Installed via DRA.

Added to `dev-tools-install.sh` file in the Debian Linux post install scripts.

## Debian Linux

Its a good time for a package upgrade as I am not doing anything critical and I think everything is backed up or pushed to the cloud.  I have Debian Live on a USB stick if something should go badly wrong.

I created the Debian Live stick after a certain opinionated Arch Linux based distro went badly wrong after an update.

### Regolith desktop

I use Regolith desktop as it provides an excellent tiling desktop environment.  Regolith uses the i3 window manager and packages configuration to make the window manager and tooling really simple to work with.

Now that Debian Linux Trixie has been released, I checked the Apt sources definition and I was still using the `testing` release.

The [Debian Linux instructions for Regolith](https://regolith-desktop.com/docs/using-regolith/install/#debian) use a stable URL, with trixie 3.4 as the release name.

The Apt sources on the `rogueone` computer uses the newer sources format:

!!! NOTE "Regolith apt sources for Debian Linux Trixie - new list format"
    ```config
    deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/regolith-archive-keyring.gpg] https://archive.regolith-desktop.com/debian/stable trixie v3.4 main
    ```

### Apt upgrade

```shell
apt update && apt upgrade
```

## Software development tools

I want the stability that Debian Linux provides so I don't have unexpected maintenance or show-stopping issues (like I've had with rolling releases like Arch Linux).

Some of the development tools I use regularly do not have their latest version packaged in Debian, however, I have a simple script that uses [Download Release Artifices (DRA)]() tool to download and install the latest version of a tool from its GitHub Repository.

Some tools also provide a handy install script, like Node.js.

I am creating a series of scripts, one for each tool.

A 'debian-linux-post-install' script will call each tool script to installs (or updates) everything in one go.  This is most useful after a fresh install of Debian Linux (or if tools havent been updated in a considerable time).


### Nodejs

A script was created to install Node.js, using the official script on the website.  This script was updated to use the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvm/` location for Node Version Manager (NVM) if it exists, otherwise use the classic `$HOME/.nvm/` location.

The script needs to source the NVIM location after NVM is installed, so that NVM can be used to install Node.js within the same script.

!!! NOTE "Nodejs Dev Tool install script for Debian Linux"
    ```shell
    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    # NOTE: run this script after setting up preferred shell, e.g. zsh
    # and XDG environment variables are defined
    # as the NVM script adds itself to the shell resource configuration

    echo "# ---------------------------------------"
    echo "Nodejs install via Node Version Manager - NVM"

    # Nodejs official install script for vm
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

    # Source the NVM script
    if [ -d $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvm ]; then
     echo "Source NVM script from XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim"
     \. "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvm/nvm.sh"
    else
     echo "Source NVM script from HOME/.nvim"
     \. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
    fi

    # Install the given version of nodejs
    nvm install 24

    # Confirm node was installed
    node --version
    echo "# ---------------------------------------"
    ```


??? EXAMPLE "Install of Nodejs & NPM via NVM - X"
    ```shell-output
    ❯ ./nodejs-nvm-install-node24.sh

## Desktop Display Manager

GDM2 was the default window manager when I installed Debian Linux (Gnome desktop environment).  This is a good tool but was curious as to the other options.

Lightdm is a lightweight greeter with theme support.  It is packaged in several deb packages, so only the features needed can be installed.

SDDM is a popular tool with Hyprland based distributions, as it is highly configurable.

### LightDM

LightDM package has very few package dependencies, most of which are related to LightDM or would be installed with any greeter.

I've used the de facto gtk greeter which does the job nicely.

      * Fully themeable
      * Cross-desktop (greeters can be written in any toolkit)
     .
     Additional software can be useful along with LightDM:
      * xserver-xephyr can be used to add a nested X display by calling
       'dm-tool add-nested-seat`
      * upower can be used to suspend the computer from the display manager
      * accountsservice is used to populate a user list with addition information.
    ```


### LightDM Themes

LightDM install on Debian Linux includes a simple Debian based theme.

The arctica theme makes LightDM similar in appearance to the Gnome and KDE style greeters.

EDIT: In hindsight I may switch back to the default theme as Arctica depends on `evolution` packages (not required for anything else).

### SDDM

SDDM is commonly used with the KDE desktop environment and Hyprland compositor, as its highly customisable and has a wide availability of themes.

SDDM supports both X11 and Wayland sessions.

The Debian Linux package for SDDM depends on many additional packages, although when using KDE rather than Gnome many of these packages will already be installed.
