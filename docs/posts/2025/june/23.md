The [Neovim section on the Clojure LSP site](#clojure-lsp) needed an update, so I created a PR with more information and updated configuration links.

[Bicycle maintenance and a few final ride](#cycling) this week in preparation for the ride around the Isle of Wight. There were more replacements than I first thought, brake pads, cleats, pedals. I have done lots of long distance riding for most of the last 6 years (except the COVID years) so I shouldn't have been surprised.

I have been looking at more products from [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) and revisited the [Trace Velo video about Ali Express and if its worth it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bdB2qt0Tp8) for tips on getting the most out of this website. If you know exactly what you are looking for and buy from established companies, then it is as good as using services like Amazon.

[Panda Podium](https://www.pandapodium.cc/) is a company that makes it easy to find quality products from China based manufactures, greatly reducing the risk.  They also have some good reviews of products too.

Investigating the Rust language again this week, in between the cycle training, maintenance and heatwave ü§£  There is a great looking deployment platform called Shuttle for Rust apps, feels like the same enjoyable experience as Heroku.

Tv & Movies this week:

- Blade Runner: The Final Cut - one of my favourite films of all time, I never get tired of watching.
- [Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(2024_film)) a wonderful movie (especially if you love cats, which I do). Animation and music were very moving.

## Clojure LSP

Created a Pull Request to update the Client (editor) page on the website with newer approaches to configuring Clojure LSP for Neovim, using Mason and nvim-lspconfig.

MERGED: [#2079 docs: update neovim config](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/pull/2079){target=_blank .md-button}


## Rust

Published more pages as I continue to learn a bit more about rust in between all the cycling and resting (and eating).


### Shuttle

A service for deploying services created with the Rust language.  Shuttle takes the Infrastructure as Code approach.

Shuttle has a command line tool that can also create Rust projects, optionally from one of the project templates that Shuttle created.

!!! NOTE "Install Shuttle CLI"
    ```shell
    curl -sSfL https://www.shuttle.dev/install | bash
    ```

    ```

The Shuttle installer script hard-codes the location of Cargo

```shell title="https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/blob/main/install.sh#L271-L279"
  tar -xzf "cargo-shuttle-$LATEST_VERSION-$target.tar.gz" || _exit_failure "tar-extract-binary"
  echo "Installing to $HOME/.cargo/bin/cargo-shuttle"
  mv "cargo-shuttle-$target-$LATEST_VERSION/cargo-shuttle" "$HOME/.cargo/bin/" || _exit_failure "move-binary"
  echo "Installing to $HOME/.cargo/bin/shuttle"
  mv "cargo-shuttle-$target-$LATEST_VERSION/shuttle" "$HOME/.cargo/bin/" || _exit_failure "move-binary"
  popd >/dev/null || _exit_failure "popd"
  if [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$HOME/.cargo/bin:"* ]]; then
    echo "Add $HOME/.cargo/bin to PATH to access the 'shuttle' command"
  fi
```

As there were no options to change the location of the shuttle install, a symbolic link was created to point to the current `CARGO_HOME` location.

!!! NOTE "Create symbolic link to CARGO_HOME"
    ```shell
    ln -s $CARGO_HOME/ $HOME/.cargo
    ```

Raised [an issue to support CARGO_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variables](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/2068) in the shuttle CLI.


### REST service with Axum

Use the shuttle CLI to create a new project.  The shuttle cli will create a directory of the given project name (so no need to create a directory first).

```shell
shuttle init --template axum
```

> NOTE: project names have specific naming rules

```shell-output
‚ùØ shuttle init --template axum
First, let's log in to your Shuttle account.
Complete login in Shuttle Console to authenticate the Shuttle CLI.
If your browser did not automatically open, go to https://console.shuttle.dev/device-auth?token=xtv7BVNefKg8kaJ7

Token: xtv7BVNefKg8kaJ7

Logged in as user_01JYMBJZ4D8DR3D6STABQZVAC1

‚úî Project name ¬∑ Gameboard
Invalid project name. Project names must:
  1. only contain lowercase letters, numbers, or dashes `-`,
  2. be between 1 and 32 characters long,
  3. not start or end with a dash,
  4. not contain profanity.
Try a different name.
Type the same name again to use "Gameboard" anyways.
‚úî Project name ¬∑ gameboard

Where should we create this project?
‚úî Directory ¬∑ .

Creating project "gameboard" in "/home/practicalli/projects/rust/gameboard"

‚úî Create a project on Shuttle with the name "gameboard"? ¬∑ yes

Linking to project proj_01JYMMH5ZHV4CVDVEEH1N99X09

```

Deploy the generated project on the shuttle platform.

### Developing the example

Return Json rather than a static string.

Comment the `hello_world` function and add the following replacement

```rust
async fn hello_world() -> impl IntoResponse {
    // the json! macro is from the serde_json library
    let hello_world = json!({ "hello": "world" });

    (StatusCode::OK, hello_world)
}
```


Add the crate for the json! macro.  This sets rust_analyzer in action to analyse the new library.

```shell-output
‚ùØ cargo add serde_json
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding serde_json v1.0.140 to dependencies
             Features:
             + std
             - alloc
             - arbitrary_precision
             - float_roundtrip
             - indexmap
             - preserve_order
             - raw_value
             - unbounded_depth
```


### Errors and troubleshooting

Errors in the editor and `cargo build` is failing.  There were missing Crates to add, but even after that rust_analyzer is complaining and `cargo build` fails.

Can `rustc` explain the error I am experiencing?


```shell-output
‚ùØ rustc --explain E0433
An undeclared crate, module, or type was used.

Erroneous code example:

let map = HashMap::new();
// error: failed to resolve: use of undeclared type `HashMap`

Please verify you didn't misspell the type/module's name or that you didn't forget to import it:

use std::collections::HashMap; // HashMap has been imported.
let map: HashMap<u32, u32> = HashMap::new(); // So it can be used!

If you've expected to use a crate name:

use ferris_wheel::BigO;
// error: failed to resolve: use of undeclared module or unlinked crate

Make sure the crate has been added as a dependency in Cargo.toml.

To use a module from your current crate, add the crate:: prefix to the path.

### xfreedesktop support

I raised an issue on the Shuttle CLI tool repository to [consider supporting CARGO_HOME and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/issues/2068#issuecomment-3016617275).

On further investigation it seems not so simple, as the main rust tools do not support the xfreedsktop standards.

The rustup tool is a popular choice for installing and managing rust versions.  Cargo is the tool for managing library dependencies.

Both these tools would need to support the xfreedesktop standard and ideally their updated be co-ordinated to avoid disruption to existing rust development installations.

Just updating the Shuttle install script to use the `CARGO_HOME` environment variable (if set) would be sufficient at present.


### OpenAPI

Open API docs can be added to a Rust API using the utoipa & utoipa_swagger_ui crates, in conjunction with a web framework, e.g. axum or actix-web.

Defining API endpoints, data structures and responses with OpenAPI attributes which will generate an OpenAPI specification (JSON and/or YAML format). The OpenAPI docs can be served using the Swagger UI to visualize and interact with the API.


1. Include dependencies in the project `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
# ----------------------------------------
# Web framework
axum = "0.8.4"
serde_json = "1.0.140"
shuttle-axum = "0.55.0"
shuttle-runtime = "0.55.0"
tokio = "1.45.1"
# ----------------------------------------

# ----------------------------------------
# OpenAPI (Swagger)
utoipa = { version = "5.4.0" }
utoipa-swagger-ui = { version = "9.0.2", features = ["axum"] }
# ----------------------------------------
```


2. Define Data Structures and API Endpoints:

    `utoipa::ToSchema derive` macro enables OpenAPI schema generation for data structures.

    `utoipa::OpenApi attribute` defines the structure of the API, including paths, components, and tags.

    `utoipa::path attribute` added to route handlers specifies HTTP methods, paths, parameters and expected responses.


3. Create the OpenAPI Specification:

    `utoipa::OpenApi` generates the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification in JSON or YAML format.

    The specification is used by Swagger UI to visualize and interact with the API.

4. Serve Swagger UI:

    `utoipa_swagger_ui::SwaggerUi` serves the Swagger UI via a specific route definition

    Configure SwaggerUi to point to the generated OpenAPI specification


## Cycling

Upgraded the 'out-front' arm from an aluminium to a carbon arm.  The new arm feels like it weighs nothing but seems sturdy enough.  The next ride should determine if that is the case.

On longer rides I have been feeling a little discomfort on the saddle, although it wasnt so noticable on the long Saturday ride.

I got a 3D printed saddle that I saw reviewed on [TraceVello YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/TraceVelo.  I had to get an alternate seat clamp for the Ribble to support the 7x9 carbon rails the saddle has. The chrome alloy saddles are 7x7 and the original Ribble bike seat clamp only supports that size).

A short ride with the saddle felt okay, once it was in the right position.  A longer ride should give me a good indication as to the comfort compared to my existing saddle (which is 6 years old now but still looks in good condition).

Update: the saddle was okay but it felt like the 3D comb was slightly digging into my posterior.  I have swapped back to my original saddle and slightly adjusted to an even comfier position.

On the last ride my shoes did unclip themeselves a little too easy.  I have fitted new shoe cleats and fitted the Look Kleo pedals from my Bianchi (which seem less worn than the Ribble pedals).  I do need to get some new pedals soon though.


### Bone conducting headphones

I have used [AfterShock bone conducting headpohones](), now called Shock, since the summer of 2019.  Gaiville and I went to a cycle show at the Excel centre in London and had a bit of a shopping spree.  The Aftershock headphones were not cheap, around 100 GBP at the time, but they have lasted over 6 years and worked flawlessly in that time.

Unfortunately the Aftershock headphones are no longer switching on.  They seem to be charging (although there are a few times they seem to have pretended to charge and then not work).

I was looking at replacements last week but didnt find anything that stood out.  The Aftershock headphones still will not switch on after another charge, so it was time for new ones.

The [Mozone Bone Conductor headphones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FB3J5VS7) stood out as they had Bluetooth v6.0 and battery life for 12 hours of continuous play.  The aftershock had about 6 hours, although I think that was starting to significantly reduce (or the battery inside wasnt charging up as much).

Luckily Amazon decided to offer me a free 30 day trial of Prime and I could get the headphones delivered the same day (as I was going for a ride the next morning).

The headphones arrived by 21:00 and were in a nice box.  The headphones felt quite plastic (probably because they are).  Probably not as sturdy as the Aftershock, but a quarter of the price.

The headphones were mostly charged so I topped them up in less than 15 minutes.  Bluetooth connected straight away, identifying as X3.  The sound is really good, far better than I remember with the Aftershock headphones.  The sound is crisp and clear and sounds very similar to in-ear headphones.

The real test will be on the roads when I am pushing myself up a big hill with occasional traffic passing me by.


### Isle of Wight cycle trip

A very enjoyable cycle around the Isle of Wight, dispite (or maybe because of) a potentially ride ending fault.

On the ferry over to the Isle of Wight, it seems that the thumb-screw on the rear derailleur snapped off and the effort of cycling had started fraying the gear cable.

I noticed something was amis when I could no longer switch up into the largest gear on the rear cassette.  I tried adjusting the derailleur thumb-screw but with now affect (it did feel loose but I didnt realise it had actually snapped).

When we got to the Mouse Inn for lunch, I ordered a Vegan Mexican burger and went to inspect my bike in more detail.

To my great concern I discovered the gear cable was only holding on by a couple of thread and most of the threads of the cable had snapped.

The gearing is internally routed so there isn't much that could be done to hack a solution, certainly not one that would last for the second half of the ride.

After an obviously futile attempt to see if anyone had a spare gear cable (which still wouldn't have fixed the problem by itself), Alex found [Adrian's bike shop](https://www.adriansbikeshop.com/) bike shop that was near the route.

A quick call to Andrew's bike shop confirmed that they had time to replace the gear cable, so long as I got their by 4pm.  This would be easy to do if the cable stays attached ü§£

I left lunch early and zoomed over to the bike shop as fast as I could, whilst trying to minimise the gear changes to avoid extra strain on the gear cable.

I took the direct route along military road and up the two hills to Fishwater bay, really pushing myself so I didn't need to change gear.  It was challenging to stop myself changing gear as its a very automatic response to the road gradient and condition.  I kept an eye on my heart rate to ensure I wasn't going to kill myself.  My heart rate was in the high 150 beats per minute but didn't go over 160.

My estimated heart rate maximum is 165 and 80% would be 140.25 beats per minute, so I was really pushing myself all the way to the bike shop.

> NOTE: Maximum heart rate is estimated by subtracting a persons age from 220 beats per minute.  For cycling the target heart rate should be between 65%-80% of the maximum heart rate.

At the bottom of the hill in Fishwater bay I turned right and another 6 minutes I had made it to the bike shop with one thread of the gear cable still holding on.

Adrian was kind enough to start working on the bike straight away and in less than 15 minutes I was ready to go again.  As the thumbscrew on the derailleur had snapped, Adrian had to remove the thread still left inside, but that was quickly done.

21 GBP for the repair and components and I was ready to go.

I sent the group I had been riding with a meeting point just after Totland promenade and caught up with them without slowing down their ride.

I did miss about 4 km of the route we were following around the island, but still managed a 103.88 km ride overall.


### Tire pressures

The tire pressure you should choose has quite a lot of aspects to consider.

A quick guide is to use the [SILCA Pro Tire Pressure Calculator](https://silca.cc/en-gb/pages/pro-tire-pressure-calculator) or better still check the specific tire manufactures website for tire pressures according to rider weight.

In general, the lower the tire pressure the higher the risk of puncture.  Tubeless tires can run lower pressures because punctures should be self-repairing due to the sealant inside the tube (assuming that sealant is well maintained).

Aspects to consider:

- The whole weight: the bicycle, rider in kit including shoes, tools, water bottles filled with water
- Width of tire: wider tires tend to need lower pressure, e.g. 23C over 100 PSI, 28C around 90 PSI
- Road surface: a difficult aspect unless you are only cycling on a surface designed for cycling (e.g. velodrome, cycle park, etc.).  Significantly rougher surfaces can benefit from a little less pressure.

> NOTE: tire pressure that is too low on rough surfaces may feel smoother, until you hit a large pot hole at speed and damage the wheel rim or pinch the inner tube and get a puncture.  Never go below the tire manufacturers minimum recommended pressure.
