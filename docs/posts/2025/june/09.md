I had an interview for a new role last week and it seems a very interesting company. The seem very organised and clear in their communication and I am on to the next step :smiley_cat:

Putting the finishing touches to the [Debian Linux install on the Lenovo Extreme laptop](#debian-linux).  Reviewed the [Debian Linux mirrors](http://deb.debian.org/){target=_blank} work as its been a while.  `deb.debian.org` contains the SRV records in DNS that manages the routing to the most appropriate package archive, so I dont need to do anything to have the best mirror.

I found a [solution to GTK4 apps not using the dark theme](#configure-dark-theme-in-gtk4-apps) in i3 (Regoligth), so the world is a happy place again :face_with_rolling_eyes:

Testing out 1Password password manager as a replacement for NordPass which was used for the last couple of years. :crossed_fingers:

Update: 1Password is so much nicer experience getting setup so I will definitely switch.  An interesting thing I saw when signing up for an account was that 1Password first did a credit card check by trying to take 1 USD from my account.  As the account was empty then my bank refused the withdrawal.  So 1Password asked for $0 dollars instead, which my bank app prompted me to accept.  I have 7 days trial to change my mind before they take the annual payment (32 Euros).

Started the [Practicalli Rust book](https://practical.li/rust){target=_blank} although this is only the structure of the book and the CI publishing workflow for the moment.  It does provide a central place to capture all my experiences with Rust and hopefully it will become useful to others in the near future.

TV & Movies this week:

- Evil Dead III - Army of Darkness: my favorite movie of the series, I've watched this dozens of times and always enjoy.
- Paradise - an interesting show with good characters
- Rich and Morty season 8 on Channel 4: first two episodes have been very enjoyable.

## Debian Linux

Continuing to install packages and configure for software development and content creation.

The `ip` command shows the current IP addresses on the local computer.

```shell
ip --brief address
```

Using the `--brief` flag shows the IP addresses in an simple to read format.

```shell-output
❯ ip --brief address
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
enp0s31f6        UP             192.168.0.212/24 fe80::4a2a:e3ff:fe6b:1146/64
wlp82s0          UP             192.168.0.221/24 fe80::5035:6baa:abba:69d/64
```

### 1password

I have been using NordPass password manger for the last 2 years and its has been okay.  I got this as a very cost effective bundle with NordVPN.  I used the VPN quite a lot initially, but now a lot of things I wanted it for block access from a VPN service.

NordPass by itself is a little cheaper than other password managers, but the lack of a Debian Linux package is not a good experience.  The NordPass desktop app is available as a Snap, but the use of Snaps is why I moved away from Ubuntu back to Debian Linux.

There is a good Firefox browser extension for Nordpass and the password vault can be accessed via a web page too.


Its time to test drive 1Password. Every company I've worked for over the last few years is using 1Password

#### Firefox extension

[1Password firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1password-x-password-manager/) link was presented when I selected the basic plan. A very nice touch.


#### Debian Linux install

More important to me is the availability of [a `.deb` file to download](https://1password.com/downloads/linux){target=_blank} as well a guide to adding the [1Password Personal Package Archive (PPA)](https://support.1password.com/install-linux/#debian-or-ubuntu){target=_blank}.

There is also a guide to [installing 1Password via an Arch User Repository (AUR) package](https://support.1password.com/install-linux/#arch-linux){target=_blank}.

Installation of the `.deb` package was smooth

```shell-output
❯ sudo apt install ./1password-latest.deb

The notice on the final line occurs when installing a package via sudo from a non-root user.  It doesnt seem to have affected other packages in the past.


### GitHub CLI

Debian Linux Trixie has the `gh` package although it is a little behind the releases.

The [GitHub CLI repository releases](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases) includes a Debian package which can be downloaded and installed for the latest version.


!!! NOTE "Install latest GitHub CLI release"
```shell
sudo apt install ./gh_2.74.1_linux_amd64.deb
```

TODO: Learn more of the [GitHub CLI commands](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_edit){target=_blank}


### Dark theme for GTK

Regolith Desktop themes work well but they do not cover Gnome apps.

Although Dark is selected in the Gnome desktop settings > Appearance, some applications still show as a light theme.

```shell
astro ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
```

Update this file to have dark set to true (1).

```
gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme=1
```

Not changing the appearance after closing and re-opening nautilus.  Perhaps a logout / login is required (or maybe this isnt the right setting)

Also tried for gtk-3.0 and rebooting the operating system with no difference to nautilus.

#### Configure dark theme for GTK4 apps

The i3 GitHub discussion [GTK4 apps dont respect dark theme in i3](https://github.com/i3/i3/discussions/5896#discussioncomment-8556941){target=_blank} provides a simple configuration solution to setting a dark theme.

Create (or edit) the config file `$HOME/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.conf`

!!! INFO "Solution: xdg-desktop-portal configuration"
    Create / edit the $HOME/.config/xdg-desktop-portal/portals.config file to have the following default
    ```config
    [preferred]
    default=gtk;wlr
    ```


## nvidia graphics drivers

The new install on the Lenovo Extreme laptop is working well, except video playback is not always completely smooth.

The laptop has nvidia hardware and Debian Linux doesnt prompt to install closed source drivers for nvidia video cards by default.

There an extensive [guide to nvidia hardware on Debian Linux Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers){target=_blank}.

Update the Apt sources.list file to include `contrib` and `non-free` sections of the archive to make use of the proprietary nvidia driver software.

```config
# ----------
# Testing - trixie
# Includes contrib & non-free packages and sources for nvidia video card support

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ trixie main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ trixie main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
deb-src http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
# ----------
```

Install `nvidia-detect` to determine which nvidia driver should be installed (hopefully it should be the universal `nvidia-driver` although some graphics hardware may required an earlier driver package).


```shell
apt install nvidia-detect
```

Run the script

```shell
nvidia-detect
```

```shell-output
➜  ~ nvidia-detect
Detected NVIDIA GPUs:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation TU117M [GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile / Max-Q] [10de:1f91] (rev a1)

Checking card:  NVIDIA Corporation TU117M [GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1)
Your card is supported by all driver versions.
Your card is also supported by the Tesla 535 drivers series.
It is recommended to install the
    nvidia-driver
package.
```

Running the `nvidia-detect` script on the Leonovo Extreme laptop recommended installing the `nvidia-driver`.

```shell
apt install nvidia-driver
```

Reboot the machine for the nvidia drivers to be loaded.

> NOTE: The Lenovo Bios has to be set to hybrid graphics to run the graphical desktop once nvidia drivers were installed (because the linux-headers-amd64 package prerequisite had not been installed)

Several errors were shown when booting Debian Linux (these errors did not appear in `dmesg` output though)

Reading the wiki again, the prerequisites state installing kernel headers so the kernel can load the nvidia drivers

```shell
apt install linux-headers-amd64
```

Once the linux header package was installed and the computer rebooted, then nvidia driver worked without error.

Another reboot of the laptop and `Enter` > `F1` into the bios to set the Display to use *Discrete Graphics*, the nvidia graphics hardware.

The video playback was now flawless.


### MkDocs install

The [Practicalli Journal for September 23 2024]() documents the install steps for MkDocs on a new Debian Linux system.

<!--- TODO: add steps to Practicalli Engineering Playbook --->

## Sound recording

Debian Linux enabled the microphone by default with the maximum volume (unless I pressed some buttons without realising it).

When recording my desktop this leads to unexpected background noise at least and more likely quite noticeable sound feedback.

Muting the microphone ensured that sound recording would not be affected (until I actually need to use a microphone).


## Bike maintenance

The current saddle on the Ribble SL Disc bike has alloy rails, measuring 7x7 mm.  The new 3D printed bike from AliExpress has carbon rails which are taller than the alloy rails, 7x9 mm, and do not fit the adaptor that came with the Ribble bike.

The [Ribble carbon rail saddle clamp assembly](https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/ribble-seat-clamp-for-carbon-rails-7mm-x-9mm/){target=_blank} seems to be the accessory I would need to fit the new saddle.  Current costs are 15 GBP with an additional 5 GBP for delivery.

There are a few scratches on the Ribble, so I could also order some touch up paint.  This wouldnt add to the delivery cost, but the paint isn't exactly cheap at 19.99 GBP for a 25ml bottle :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:  They do also include a 25ml bottle of clear coat lacquer and 2 touch-up brushes.

I will try fit the new saddle to another bike and see if I find it comfortable to ride on.  If not, I will send it back and stick with my current saddle.

I do find the ribble clamp assembly very fiddly to fit as it comes apart if not careful.  There is [a specific way to fit the assembly](https://helpcentre.ribblecycles.co.uk/support/solutions/articles/22000289310-sl-seatpost-saddle-clamp-assembly-instructions){target=_blank} which requires most of it to be assembled first and attached to the saddle rails, then carefully tightened onto the top of the seat post.



## Octo and GitHub CLI

Octo is a Neovim plugin that uses the GitHub CLI to manage images and pull reuests from inside Neovim.

I am still figuring out how to make the most of it, as there are some limitations and a few of the features havent been implemented yet.

Creating an issue is via the Neovim command prompt as Octo plugin does not provide a key mapping.

The command required specification of the repository when the alias other than `origin` is used for the remote repository.

> NOTE: Practicalli uses specific alias names to clarify which account the remote repository is under, e.g. `practicalli` for the org and `practicalli-johnny` for the user account.

!!! NOTE "Create a new issue for the specified repository"
    ```shell
    :Octo issue create practicalli/rust
    ```

For commands that are not supported in Octo yet, then a terminal window or tab can be used to run GitHub CLI `gh` commands

!!! NOTE ""
```shell
gh issue edit <issue-number>
```

!!! NOTE "Add assignee to issue"
```shell
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-assignee <github-account-name>
```

!!! NOTE "Add an issue to a GitHub project"
```shell
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-project <github-project-name>
```

Adding an issue to a GitHub project fails with a rather unhelpful message.

A project needs to be added to the GitHub authorisation before adding the project to an issue.

## Astro5 Package updates

Interesting update for the Octo plugin which seems to provide basic support for issue types (although I couldnt when looking at the key maps and opening an issue with Octo).
