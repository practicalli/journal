It was too hot too think or do anything apart from watch [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks) at the start of this week.

Updated the versions of libraries used in aliases within [Practicalli Clojure CLI Config](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config) and [cut a new release](https://github.com/practicalli/clojure-cli-config/releases/tag/2025-07-01)

## Cycling

With the rear gear cable and thumbwheel replaced during the Isle of Wight trip, there are only the pedals and chain to replace ðŸ˜†

I ordered the [Look Keo Classic 3 pedals](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B071D75MTY) which are only a few grams heavier than the Look Keo Carbon Max 2 (Chrome Mobideum Steel axels).

I'll probably get the [Sram PC 1110 chain](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01BZBSSQA) again (last fitted in February).  It seems to do about 75% of the distance the Shimano chain can do, but is at least half the price.  Replacing the chains is a relatively simple task that I can do that myself, thanks to the chain having quick links.

### Cassette

My chain is close to being worn so its also useful to review if the cassette needs replacing too.

I believe one reason these cassettes are so light is that the lugs that hold them onto the hub slots are only part of the length of the hub.  This may be the part they had to strengthen, or it could be another part.

Although these are light cassettes, I think I will avoid them until I am less than 80km in rider weight.

## Rust

Installed rust using default locations using the [install Rust script](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

??? EXAMPLE "rustup install - default location"
    ```shell-output
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    info: downloading installer
    warn: It looks like you have an existing rustup settings file at:
    warn: /home/practicalli/.rustup/settings.toml
    warn: Rustup will install the default toolchain as specified in the settings file,
    warn: instead of the one inferred from the default host triple.

    Welcome to Rust!

    This will download and install the official compiler for the Rust
    programming language, and its package manager, Cargo.

    Rustup metadata and toolchains will be installed into the Rustup
    home directory, located at:

      /home/practicalli/.rustup

    This can be modified with the RUSTUP_HOME environment variable.

    The Cargo home directory is located at:

      /home/practicalli/.cargo

    This can be modified with the CARGO_HOME environment variable.

    The cargo, rustc, rustup and other commands will be added to
    Cargo's bin directory, located at:

      /home/practicalli/.cargo/bin

    This path will then be added to your PATH environment variable by
    modifying the profile files located at:

      /home/practicalli/.profile
      /home/practicalli/.bashrc
      /home/practicalli/.zshenv

    You can uninstall at any time with rustup self uninstall and
    these changes will be reverted.

    Current installation options:


       default host triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
         default toolchain: stable (default)
                   profile: default
      modify PATH variable: yes

    1) Proceed with standard installation (default - just press enter)
    2) Customize installation
    3) Cancel installation

    Rust is installed now. Great!

    To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
    This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
    Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

    To configure your current shell, you need to source
    the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

    This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
    . "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
    source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
    source $"($nu.home-path)/.cargo/env.nu"  # For nushell
    ```
