Neovim 0.11 was released last week along with AstroNvim 5, so its [time for some testing](#neovim) with [Practicalli Astro](https://github.com/practicalli/astro) configuration for Neovim.

A sunny week ahead and my focus will be on [health and fitness](#health-and-fitness) this week.  I have managed to be regular with my walking, although I am still very slow when cycling (especially the hills of Kent).

I have been using LinkedIn to consider the [next steps in my career](#career).  Unless there is a really interesting role, I am tempted to focus more on community work or maybe part-time / contract work.

## Neovim

Neovim 0.11 has been released and is available on the Neovim GitHub repository.

Neovim 0.11 is already available on Termux (Android), although I'll wait until testing is complete before installing there.

There are a few breaking changes with Neovim 0.11 although the vast majority of the release is enhanced API & features.

[:globe_with_meridians: Neovim 0.11 release notes](https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.11.html){target=_blank .md-button}

!!! TIP "The Neovim release build shows deprecated APIs"
    Use the [Neovim 0.11 stable release](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) to avoid lots of Vim API deprecation warnings, especially when moving to a major version.

    Use the [Neovim 0.11 release build](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.0) to find issues with the Neovim user config and plugins that have not adapted to breaking changes in the Vim API.

    TODO: not sure this actually works as I think it does, as neovim 0.11 is also showing deprecation warnings.  Seems the only option is to check the config and raise issues with plugin maintainers


### AstroNvim

AstroNvim version 5 has also been released and a new AstroNvim template created to generate a user configuration.

There are quite a few plugin changes in AstroNvim v5, although the features should be equivalent.

The approach described in the [AstroNvim v5 migration page](https://docs.astronvim.com/configuration/v5_migration/) is sensible.  I will create a [Practicalli nvim-astro5](https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5) and review astronvim without my customisations and plugins.

Having two config repositories will allow people to migrate at their own convenience (or stay with the AstroNvim v4 config for as long as they like).

# ## Testing Setup

I've installed Neovim 0.11 on my main computer and using it most of the time, testing this new release with [Practicalli Astro](https://github.com/practicalli/astro).

Neovim 0.11 has been installed alongside Neovim 0.10, so there is a fallback approach.

```config
# ------------------------------------------
# Neovim Aliases for multiple configurations
alias astro="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astro nvim"
alias astro5="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astro5 nvim11"
alias astro11="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astro nvim11"
alias astrotemplate="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astronvim5-template nvim11"

# Neovide alias with AstroNvim configuration
alias neovide="NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-astro neovide"
# ------------------------------------------
```

### Neogit

When using commit ammend in the neogit status buffer, a prompt displays warning that the commit has already been pushed.

This prompt triggers a deprecation notification, indicating it is using a depreated vim api.

```
vim.tbl_islist is deprecated. Run ":checkhealth vim.deprecated" for more information
```

```



#### Commit amend issue

The dialog to confirm modifying an already pushed commit triggers a notification warning.

In `lua/neogit/lib/buffer.lua` the Lua LSP server shows a deprecation warning in the `function Buffer:add_highlight` (line 456)

`nvim_buf_add_highlight` is deprecated

From the [Neovim docs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/deprecated.html#deprecated-0.11):
nvim_buf_add_highlight() Use [vim.hl.range()](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.hl.range()) or [nvim_buf_set_extmark()](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_buf_set_extmark())


FYI: `test/util/git_harness.lua` uses `vim.api.nvim_exec` which has been deprecated Since Neovim 0.9, with `vim.api.nvim_exec2` the recommended replacement.


I started [a discussion on deprecated APIs](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+deprecation) on the Neogit repository.


## Linux

I have used Ubuntu for the last 15 years (possibly a bit more) and it has been an excellent desktop operating system, especially for software development.

Recently there has been a trend to ship software as snaps by default, rather than the excellent Debian package format (*.deb files).  Web browser software is only offered as snaps from the Ubuntu repositories.

Whist snaps provide convienience to packaging certain apps for the maintainers, it doesnt provide a good experience for the users of Ubuntu.

A notable example was when Firefox started shipping as a snap so that Mozilla could push security updates, specifically for libraries that Firefox used.  The snap is self-contained so all the code and libraries are in one package, rather than sharing libraries via their debian package.

The experience using Firefox as a snap has greatly improved, although startup time was a major concern initially.

The problem remains that snaps are a very inefficient use of filespace (which admittedly is relatively cheap today).  Snaps also keep the previous version when updating (so they can quickly be rolled back) and its not possible to configure Snaps to only install one version.  I havent found a nice tool to remove older snaps either, so a manual delete is sometimes required.

However, when backing up an older Ubuntu system I discovered that snap was using atleast 16 Gb of storage.  3 Gb in the user directory and 13 Gb in the `/var/lib` directory.

This use of filespace is ludicrus when comparing to the 235 Mb Firefox Debian package.

Ubuntu maintainers announced they are going to include many more snaps by default, so its another reason I am happy to be moving back to Debian.




## Career

I have been casually looking for a new role, although with a focus to consider how to prepare for a really good interview (especially if I go for another engineering manager or head of engineering role).

Some enhancements have been made to the Experiences section on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jr0cket/), providing a greater insight into my very wide experiences over the last few decades.

I am finding some interesting posts on LinkedIn, especially from [Simon Wardley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwardley/), so I plan to share my own thoughts and blog posts there.

Although chronologically speaking I could consider retirement this year, I dont feel like retiring and 5-10 more years of work would be good for the bank balance (and pension fund).


## Health and Fitness

Walking

Walk to doctors

Cycling

Capturing health statistics using a Google sheet and adding charts to help track my progress.

I was on medication last year for my diabeties, but it really did drain my energy levels and I was already quiet tired from lingering covid symptoms.  I was exhausted after each day of work.  I had no energy to do any exercise before or after work.  I wasnt sleeping well either so eventually it became very hard to manage my mood and mental health.

My blood-sugar levels had spiked massively after 4 months of taking the medication, so I decided to stop and see if I could revert back to exercise to manage diabetes.

After a month of being off the medication my body stopped being in pain all the time.  I did experience greater numbness in my feet and legs at first, but as I started with gentle exercise this numbness became less frequent.

After two months off the medication, my mood and mental health were much more positive.  I was able to do longer walks and more often.

I also managed to do a significant cycle ride (after a few warm up rides).  I am still far behind the stamina and ability I was at last summer, but am hopeful that in the next month I will be much closer to some minimum fitness.

I have also lost 9 kg in weight since I stopped taking the medication.


## Entertainment

Its good to have something to distract my mind as I recover from the increased exercise.

I signed up to Amazon Prime for a month to catch up on some movies before they disappear from that service.

- Fiddler On The Roof
- Rollerball - the 1975 version with  (not the more recent remake which I did not enjoy).
- Capolte
- The Evil Dead - the first movie of a quite scary, bizarre and occasionally funny & silly trilogy.  Evil Dead 3 is one of my favourite movies and Bruce Campbell was an excellent flawed hero.
- Moon has grown on me a lot more after the first view, I really enjoyed the story and Sam Rockwell conveyed the pain of isolation and loss.
