Its the end of the tax year in the UK in a few weeks, so I have been busy ensuring I maximise my pension contributions.  I am able to make a significant pension contribution this tax year (and hopefully get a nice repayment via self-assessment later in the year).

I am still interested in using [Hyprland](#hyprland) (and many related packages) for a tiling desktop environment with excellent UX.  I came across Garuda Linux with has many kinds of editions, one being Hyprland.

## Practicalli

I have archived quite a few repositories on GitHub recently and realised I could tidy up the Practicalli Org by creating a [Practicalli Archive](https://github.com/practicalli-archive) Org, then transferring over the archived repositories.  I'm also transferring archived repositories from my user account, practicalli-johnny.

> NOTE: I could simply delete the repositories, but then I would loose my collaboration total (not that it is that important).

## Hyprland

[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/) is based on Arch Linux but proports to provide a much simpler way to manage the OS.

The Hyprland edition seems worth evaluating and hopefully not as complex as all the different HyDE configs (and multiple config locations).

Once the Lenovo Extreme X1 has been backed up I will test drive Guarda Linux (and any other approaches to a simple to manage Hyprland desktop)


## Health and Fitness

After a lazy weekend to try and recharge I managed more exercise this week.

Wednesday was a sunny day so I made it out for a substantial cycle ride.  Following a level 4 Club ride, I covered 79.25 km in 3 hours 48 minutes.  The total assent was 893 meters (although it felt a lot more, especially ascending Bugs Hill).

I try a ride with the local cycling club on Saturday, unfortunately I couldnt keep up with the group I road wiyh last year.

I struggled all the way round, probably due to being tired from Wednesdays ride (and it was much colder and early in the morning). I was pleased to simply make it  all the way around.

I was exhausted for the rest of the day, although managed to keep busy for the rest if the day and had a good long sleep overnight.
