After a kernel panic with Arch Linux after a package upgrade (and many other issues), I will switch my main machine back to Debian Linux.

I did have a [small issue with Regolith on Debian](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/issues/1104#issuecomment-3457153534){target=_blank} after an update, but there was a fix already defined that was quick to apply successfully.

## Arch Linux

After an update of Arch Linux today I was greeted with the Linux blue screen of death (something I have never seen before on any Linux system - but plenty of times on Windows).

I have experienced more failures after updating in the last 6 months with Arch Linux, than I experienced with Debian Linux in the last two decades.

Using Garuda Linux Hyprland I was able to use Btrfs and snappy-tools to roll-back updates, but when I had to roll-back most of the software updates it was creating a significant overhead.

This time the Btrfs roll-backs seemed to fail, because there was less than 10Gb of file storage space left.  I was surprised that so much space is required for a system update and Btrfs snapshots.

Luckily I had my older computer on which I created a [Debian Live USB disk](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/), so I could boot the failing Arch Linux machine and backup the files over the network.  I used Caligula TUI app to create the USB boot disk from the Debian Live image.

With Debian Live running I could access the Arch Linux file space using the Nautilus file browser.  I used the Network section to mount the older laptop file system, so I could copy and move files.

Although Arch Linux is interesting and Hyprland is nice to use, this combination seems far too unreliable to be my day to day operating system.  Btrfs is an interesting approach to manage change, but it seems quite inefficient if it requires so much file space for snapshots.

I plan to install Debian Linux on the main computer.  Once I have that set up, I can experiment with Wayland and Sway (or other alternatives to Hyprland that are more mature).
