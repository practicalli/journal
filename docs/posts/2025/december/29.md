The last week of 2025 and the start of 2026.

Started 2026 with a Park Run (jog) with a Strava time of 27 minutes 46 seconds, but that doesn't seem right as I think my fitness tracker got confused.  My Park Run recorded time was 35 minutes and 25 seconds, which isn't bad considering I was a minute late to the start :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

My injuries continue to recover.  I have some exercises to help with 'tennis elbow' and 'trigger finger' in my left arm and hand.  An icy walk to the Podiatrist on Friday confirms that the diabetic ulcer has pretty much gone, so now I can start testing activities to see if any of them stop the ulcer from completely healing or getting worse.

Started the slow migration from Material for MkDocs to Zensical.  The first step is to create a new book with Zensical before migrating existing books.  I've started by creating [Practicalli Cycling](https://practical.li/cycling).


Preparing for a lot of cycling in the new year with some shopping for bicycle and general winter items.

- Shimano R8000 Cassette, 11-32
- Shimano HG701 Chain
- Cospo Cadence sensor (the Garmin sensor got lost some where)
- Insulated stainless steel water bottles - stop my water getting even colder during the winter months
- neck warmers, with breathable mesh around mouth (stop the warmer getting too damp)
- mini bike chain pliers - small enough to carry in top bag in case of issues with chain
- XOSS XL400 light - a lighter weight light for shorter rides (up to 4 hours)
- mini cycle saddle bag - a compact bag for TPU inner tubes which should not obstruct the rear light mounted on the seat post


Testing out the reliability of the NAS raid array by watching some classic movies via the DNLP server.

## Practicalli

Goals for the year (so far).

- Migrate all books and journal to Zensical (estimate: summer-winter)
- Decommission books that will no longer be worked on (e.g. Doom Linux)
- Automate dependency updates for all websites and Clojure projects
- Sustainable Life: first major release
- Software Engineering: first major release
- Learning Clojure: first major release
- Engineering Playbook: extend practices section
- Clojure Web Services: rewrite book, drop older content


### Practicalli Cycling

Create a directory for Practicalli Cycling in `~/projects/practicalli/books-new/cycling/`.

Using `uv` to manage Python packages within this project.

- create a Python Virtual environment
- activate the virtual environment
- create a Python project (creates `pyproject.toml` file)
- install Zensical package in virtual environment (zensical added to `pyproject.toml` file)
- create a Zensical project from template (includes GitHub workflow for publishing)


!!! NOTE "Create Python Virtual Environment"
    ```shell
    uv venv
    ```

!!! NOTE "Create Zensical project from template"
    ```shell
    zensical new .
    ```


GitHub CLI was used to create a remote repository from the local git repository (once files had been committed).

Before publishing the website on Github, the repository must be configured via Settings > Pages to use a GitHub workflow.  No workflow needs to be added as the `.github/workflows/docs.yml` workflow is added when creating the Zensical project from the template.


## Neovim

Time for another plugin and lsp update check.

After the update on 'rogueone' I noticed that the marksman tool was no longer installed via Mason, so I did not see heading prompts when auto-completing links starting with `#`.

Marksman was installed manually via the Mason menu, `SPC p m`, and navigating to the marksman tool, pressing `i` to install.

`xclip` Debian package allows text to be copied from the terminal to Neovim and vice versa.  If `xclip` is installed after running Neovim, then Neovim must be restarted for the clipboard to work.


### Sort lines of text

In the Post Debian install script I've created, I maintain a list of package names to install in a separate file.

As I evolve the packages list, I add new packages and maintain the list in alphabetical order.  This makes it easy to find packages I have already added.

The Neovim `:sort` command will arrange a selected list of text in alphabetical order.  Select the list and run the `:sort` command.  The list updates so it remains in alphabetical order.  Note that `:sort` will put capitalised characters before all lower case characters.

`:sort` is useful for organising tags in front matter of blog posts such as Practicalli Journal.

## QNAP RAID server

Its taken a bit of time to stabalise the RAID arrays on the QNAP NAS server, but after checking the hardware and the file system it seems stable.  I may want to copy files across again to make sure they are all okay.

I had copied a large amount of files to the new RAID6 arrays as an initial test.  The copying seemed to be successful at the time.  However, on a reboot the `/dev/md0` RAID array was showing unmounted in the Storage Manager panel (QNAP web app).

I ran a [bad block check](#bad-block-check-on-all-drives) to check the hardware of each drive.  All drives completed their check successfully, which took about a day to complete.

Then ran a [file system check and repair](#check-and-fix-raid-array-partition).  This did highlight and fix some issues with the partition, but all seems good now.

I have a new 4TB drive I will swap with an older 3TB drive, which I think will fail some time this year (although it seems to be good for the moment).


### Bad block check on all drives

Using the QNAP web app, I selected each drive in turn within the Storage Manager > Volume Management panel, pressing the 'Scan Now' button to initiate the bad blocks check. After a brief pause for a UI refresh, the next drive in the list was set to scan for bad blocks.

Took most of the day and completed successfully across all drives.

One of the RAID arrays was still showing as unmounted.

## Debian Linux

I am optimising the space used by my Debian Linux install, so its not wasting space with files I will not look at.

The Debian Wiki has [suggestions for clearing up disk space](https://wiki.debian.org/DiskFreeSpace)

### Check file system usage

!!! NOTE "Check usage across local partitions"
```shell
df --hlT
```

Flag meanings

- `h` or `--human-readable` shows file use using K, M, G to simplify, in powers of 1024
- `l` or `--local` only show local partitions, including removable media, but not remotely mounted partitions
- `-T` print file system type of partitions, e.g. ext4


```shell-output
❯ df --human-readable --local -T
Filesystem           Type                       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

Or simplify the output to specific file system types, e.g. ext4 is typically used for the main file space for system and user files, e.g. / and /home/practicalli/


!!! NOTE "File usage on main partition"
    ```shell
    df --human-readable --local --type=ext4
    ```

!!! EXAMPLE "Output of File usage on main partition"
    ```shell-output
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/nvme0n1p2  444G  417G  4.6G  99% /
    ```


### System Logs

A lot of information can be logged to files in `/var/log` and unless something is seriously wrong then these logs are rarely viewed.

In fact, unless something issue happens whilst I am using the computer I am unlikely to spend time fixing issues.  Usually it is far less time consuming to re-install Debian Linux from scratch than to debug an issue that is not immediately obvious.

System logs are managed by [journalctl]()

According to `/etc/logrotate.conf` the default rotation is every 4 weeks.  I changed this to every day, so that journalctl should delete all the rotated logs after 1 day.

!!! NOTE "Check disk usage by system logs"
    ```shell
    sudo journalctl --disk-usage
    ```

!!! NOTE "Set logs to rotate daily and remove older logs"
    ```shell
    sudo journalctl --rotate
    sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1d
    ```

??? EXAMPLE "Output from rotating and vacuuming logs"
    ```shell-output
    ❯ sudo journalctl --disk-usage
    Archived and active journals take up 852.3M in the file system.

    ❯ sudo journalctl --cacuum-time=1d

    ❯ sudo journalctl --rotate

    ❯ sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=1d
    Vacuuming done, freed 0B of archived journals from /run/log/journal.

### Java install

Install the `default-jdk` package seems to be the simplest way to automate the install of the current Long Term Support (LTS) version of Java in Debian Linux.

This package also installs certificates required for running Java, from its package dependencies.

`visualvm` package is fairly recent version in the Debian Linux packages (2.10 package, the latest being 2.2 on the VisualVM website which supports features in Java 24 onward).

## Cycling

Planning for cycling in 2026 has started, even though its too cold (icy) to actually ride for the next week or so.

A good training plan for the Dragon Ride in June will ensure I can complete in a timely fashion (and hopefully be a little quicker than my friends also doing the ride).

### Statistics by year

Stats from only cycling activities for each year I have been on Strava (since June 2018)
