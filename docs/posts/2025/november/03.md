Lots of cycling this week with 4 consecutive rides, Thursday to Saturday.  The Cafe at East Peckham was closing, so we took a trip as a last farewell.  It turns out there is a new buyer, so it should be back open before we know it.

I continue to look for the most effective way of [adding data overlays to the videos captured on cycling routes](#cycling).

Continuing to evaluate [Terminal UI tools](#tuis) and finding very useful tools to understand what is going on under the hood of the operating system.

<!-- more -->


## TUIs

More Terminal (Text) user interfaces.

### systemctl-tui

[systemctl-tui](https://github.com/rgwood/systemctl-tui)  browse service status and logs, start/stop/restart/reload services, and view/edit unit files.

By default, the install script adds it to the local bin directory of the user.

However, it should be run by root or the `sudo` command so permissions are available to read the logs and carry out actions on services.

```shell
sudo /home/practicalli/.local/bin/systemctl-tui
```

Alternatively, download the latest release from the GitHub project and move to `/usr/loca/bin`.

### Systemd-manager-tui

[Systemd manager tui](https://github.com/matheus-git/systemd-manager-tui) managing systemd services through a TUI (Terminal User Interfaces).

This tool allows you to manage systemd services with ease. You can view logs, list services, view properties, and control their lifecycle—start, stop, restart, mask, unmask, enable, and disable—using the D-Bus API.

Additionally, it is possible to navigate between system and session units, choose to list either all units or only those of type 'service', and directly edit the selected unit's file. It also supports Vim-like navigation.

=== Debian Linux
    Download the `.deb` file from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/matheus-git/systemd-manager-tui/releases) and install using `apt`

    ```shell
    apt install ./systemd-manager-tui_x.x.x-x_amd64.deb
    ```

Run `systemd-manager-tui` to see active and inactive services.

`v` shows the logs from the currently highlighted service.

> NOTE: seems a little nicer to use than systemctl-tui


## Cycling

[Telemetry Overlay](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/telemetry-overlay-gps-video-sensors) is a commercial software package to add data overlays to video footage.  The software is available as a Debian Linux package, as well as MacOS and Windows.

There is a [3 day free trial](https://goprotelemetryextractor.com/telemetry-overlay-trial) that adds a watermark to the video output.  The commercial licence is a one off fee of 172 Euro.

### GPX Overlay

A [website](https://gpxoverlay.com/app) that takes a GPX file and a video to generate data overlays.

Unfortunately the website does not like the MP4 video tried to upload because the date range on the video does not match (The camera keeps resetting the date so they are rarely correct).

How to change the date range on the video?

The website will generated a video without the camera footage, creating either a transparent or green screen overlay.

The service can generate up to 10 minutes of overlay for free, as a way to test out the service.
