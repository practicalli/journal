The days are very cold now, especially when the day is not sunny.  I am determined to [get out on the bicycle](#Cycling) for several rides each week.

Previously I've have added SSH keys to my GitHub account via the GitHub website.  The GitHub CLI can add SSH keys, which is more convenient that copying the contents of the public SSH key into the website.

## Git and GitHub

GitHub CLI can add a local SSH key to your GitHub account, as an authentication key or a signing key.

Authentication scopes for the GitHub CLI must be updated to add an SSH key.

Adding a new scope requires login authentication.


!!! NOTE "Update GitHub CLI authorisation Scope to allow adding of SSH authentication key"
    ```shell
    gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:public_key
    ```

!!! NOTE "Add SSH Authentication key to GitHub account"
    ```shell
    gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/engineering.pub --type authentication --title "Practicalli Engineering"
    ```

!!! NOTE "Update GitHub CLI authorisation Scope to allow adding of SSH signing key"
    ```shell
    gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:ssh_signing_key
    ```

!!! NOTE "Add SSH Signing key to GitHub account"
    ```shell
    gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/engineering.pub --type signing --title "Practicalli Engineering"
    ```


### List Repositories

The GitHub CLI tool can be used to list repositories.

!!! NOTE "List GitHub repositories for an organisation"
    List the repositories owned by the 'Practicalli' GitHub organisation
    ```shell
    gh repo list practicalli
    ```

    Increase the repository limit from 30 (default) to 150

    ```shell
    gh repo list practicalli --limit 150
    ```

??? EXAMPLE "List of Practicalli GitHub repositories - first 30"
    ```shell-output
    gh repo list practicalli

    Showing 30 of 106 repositories in @practicalli

## Cycling

The week started sunny so I jumped on the bicycle and headed out to test out some of my new winter cycling kit.  It was 7 degrees Celsius and sunny, so felt okay with the right layers.

Tuesday was a lot colder, around 3 degrees Celsius, so more layers were required.  On top of my leg warmers, I wore a pair of cycling trousers.  For my feet, as well as 2 pairs of socks I wore my Spatz wet weather overshoes.  For the top I had my thick base layer, arm warmers, long sleeve base layer, merino jersey, jacket and Bigfoot summer Gilet.  To top it all off, a wolly hat sat under my helmet and the new thick neck warmer that came on Sunday.
