OpenAI gives a curl command to initially test the account setup, then its nothing until a credit card is added to the account.  So [is it actually worth spending money](#the-cost-of-ai) on something I cannot try out first?

Watching [Beacon 23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_23) again and enjoying it even more a second time around.  The first viewing I was a bit confused with the storyline jumps, but it makes a lot more sense now.

The Editor code assistant plugin for Neovim had a bit update, although it is [no longer running the ECA server](#eca-plugin).

## The Cost of AI

I have only touched on the plethora of so called 'AI' services and the sole thing they have in common is that they all cost money, potentially a lot of money.

My recent experience with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) were extremely disappointing.  Upon creating an account I was able to send 26 'tokens' (I assume words) to the OpenAI API to test the account.

I could not do anything of value without handing over credit card details.  So what would be my motivation to use the service if I could not experience that service?

The website does have a 'prompt' where the OpenAI model can be asked a question.  I asked why I should use OpenAI and was immediately prompted to login or create a free account.  I was able to cancel that prompt and see the answer provided.

Curiously the website address changed to [https://chatgpt.com/](https://chatgpt.com/) when replying to the question.  That seems very dubious and another example of the lack of maturity in AI services.

### The real AI hook?

There is a different hook for engineers that is far more effective than all the marketing hype and tales of 'vibe coding'.

AI models and tools to use them effectively are the 'new shiney'.  Its a new challenge to explore and create solutions.

A new challenge can be like taking a holiday for the mind, certainly a break from thinking about the day to day issues and engineer and eningeering department currently face.

Introducing a significant change like an AI service provides a lot of scope for creative thinking.

There is also the interest in the underlying technology.  Although AI concepts have been around for over a century it is only in the last few decades have we had the technology to create solutions.  The age of the Internet drove the sharing and storing of vast levels of engineering experience (along with lots of cat & dog pictures).


### GitHub Co-pilot

Apparently I can boost developer productivity for $19 per month per user.  This is usually the type of marketing spin that sees engineers run away or simply ignore.

As a business owner or head of engineering, how do I quantify that this is a good investment?

I want to ensure the engineers are being effective, which is mostly around understanding how to solve complex problems and teach a computer how to automate those actions.

An engineering team could prove value from an AI service by using it, if also given time to include analysis of its value.

Proving the value of an AI service would add to the significant learning curve needed to use a specific AI service effectively.  That learning curve becomes steeper when tools currently used in the development workflow are not the ones the AI service integrates seamlessly with.


### Why should I use OpenAI?

> NOTE: This is the reply from OpenAI when asked this question.

Using OpenAI tools—like ChatGPT—can be beneficial depending on what you're trying to accomplish. Here are some solid, practical reasons why you might choose OpenAI:

✅ 1. Boost Productivity

    Writing & Editing: Drafts, emails, reports, blog posts, and more—faster and cleaner.

    Coding Help: From debugging to generating scripts or learning a new language/framework.

    Summarization: Quickly digest articles, documents, or meetings.

✅ 2. Reliable General Knowledge

    Great for learning or exploring complex topics, simplified in clear language.

    Use it like a tutor or sounding board for math, science, history, philosophy, and more.

✅ 3. Creative Work

    Storytelling, poetry, songwriting, or idea generation.

    Design assistance, character development, or brainstorming names and branding.

✅ 4. 24/7 Availability

    Unlike a human expert, OpenAI’s tools are available anytime you need help, instantly.

✅ 5. Safe, Private, and Customizable

    You can tailor your interactions.

    Tools like Custom GPTs allow you to build purpose-specific assistants.

    Strong focus on safety and ethical AI use compared to many alternatives.

✅ 6. Integrated Ecosystem

    Works across apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, and now even web browsers via extensions or plugins.

    Can handle text, code, images, and more (especially with GPT-4o).

✅ 7. Cost-Effective for Many Use Cases

    A subscription may be cheaper than hiring help for writing, research, or basic support tasks.

When should you not use OpenAI?

    For highly sensitive data (e.g. confidential legal or medical info).

    If you're seeking authoritative legal, medical, or financial advice (should always verify with professionals).

    In environments where offline or local tools are required due to data/privacy policies.


### Analysis of answer

The first line of the reply is very telling.  Its essentially saying 'it depends'...

1. Boost productivity

    Writing & Editing: Drafts, emails, reports, blog posts, and more—faster and cleaner.

This suggests wringing and editing documents would be faster and cleaner, but I already am not keen on the grammer it is using.  It doest feel that natural and I have never seen 'more-faster' used in any written text or heard anyone speak that phrase (it sounds strange when I speak this out loud)

    Coding Help: From debugging to generating scripts or learning a new language/framework.

There is rarely an authorititive answer or standard approach to learning a programming language or a specific framework built on top of that language.

Coding help seems a fair term for this potential value. An AI service should be more effective at searching for relevant content and presenting that back in a digestible form (or at least in a fairly consistent prose).

When an AI service is less effective than a person simply searching the Internet or asking a community of peers, then that AI service delivers no value.

    Summarization: Quickly digest articles, documents, or meetings.

Summary of a document or a meeting can be very valuable (especially when an organisation has too many meetings without enough focus).




## Neovim

Continuing to test the ECA plugin and searching for an AI service that I dont have to pay for.

I don't see the value of paying an AI to 'google' things for me.
