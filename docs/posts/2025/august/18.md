On Sunday 17th August 2025 I completed 1,001 days of successive commits in GitHub (without cheating).

![Practicalli Johnny profile - GitHub activity statistics - 1000 day streak](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/github/github-profile-practicalli-johnny-1000-streak.png?raw=true){loading=lazy}

Some job hunting during the week included being contacted by a recruiter from Docker regarding an engineering manager role (security division).  The recruiter that helped get me a position at Citi also got in touch for a healthcare engineering manager role.

Planned a longer cycling route to the Isle of Grain, one of the more remote parts of Kent.  Grain village is right by the sea and there is a long sandy beach there.  As its a remote location, there are very few people around usually.

I've taken several trips to Grain with my friend Gaiville who I trained and cycled with from Lands End to John O'Groats in 2019.

I've altered the start of the route previously used to accommodate people from the local cycling club.

Movies to see

- [Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary_(film)) from the [Project Hail Mary book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary)
- [Predator: Bad Lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator:_Badlands)
- [Xeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeno_(film))
- [Watch The Skies](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/watch_the_skies)
- [Daniela Forever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniela_Forever)

Movies watched

- [September 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_5_(film)) covers the terrorist attach at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, told from the perspective of the people working at the ABC sports division who were able to broadcast live much of the tragedy.
- [A Simple Favour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Favor_(film)) with Anna Kendrick in the lead role, as the perfect mom who gets involved with some 'interesting' people.
- [Matrix trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)) a relaxing bank holiday movie marathon and even after 25 years the movies looks great and are still very engaging.

Current TV shows:

- [Twisted Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal_(TV_series)) is quirky and fun show with bizarre and disturbing characters who are also quite likeable too.
- [Star Trek Strange New Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Strange_New_Worlds) I find to be a very fresh and fun take on the Star Trek world, whilst still having darker storylines and background threads.
- [Gravity Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Falls) watching this show again for about the 5th time, using it as my brain switch on / switch off show.  I have watched Rick n Morty too many times :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

## GitHub stats

The [Practicalli Johnny GitHub profile](https://github.com/practicalli-johnny) includes a tracker for contributions to GitHub.  At the end of last week I reached over one thousand consecutive days contribution (around 2 years and 9 months).

In the time between commercial work I've always had active GitHub commit stats thanks to the work done for Practicalli. There were often gaps during commercial work where I had limited time to work other projects.

[Writing a weekly journal](https://practical.li/journal) has kept my contributions very regular, as I use the journal to capture interesting and important things I discovered each day.

Using a Journal ensures I dont forget the things I learn.  I dont need to worry about structure or where to put this content in the Practicalli books, so the journal is often the first place knowledge is shared.

I use Markdown for the Jounal and the same [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) static site rendering tool I use for all other Practicalli websites.  As its Markdown, I can write it anywhere including on my [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Android phone with Termux / Neovim](https://practical.li/neovim/termux/).

I review or search the journal for information to add to the Practicalli books or videos when I have more time available.

!!! INFO "Never obsess over GitHub stats"
    To me the streak represents that I am in a relatively healthy state and had moments of creative writing throughout the week.

    Statistics about your contributions or any other work should be beneficial to your wellbeing and not a cause for stress. Where concerns develop then use other ways to review your wellbeing and keep yourself motivated.


## Hyprland

G-Hyprland is a Garuda Linux tool to help configure Hyprland and related tools.

G-Hyprland is optional so must first be installed with ++Mod+"i"++ key binding (Garuda hyprland config).

Installing G-Hyprland rearranges the configuration into separate files and seems to override any existing hypr config.  There may be a backup by I havent found it yet, so I had to manually setup my monitor config again.

The G-Hyprland configure tool did not pick up the fact I had two monitors, one on the laptop and one external.  I could only choose one resolution which was used for both monitors.  I assume I need to define my own monitor config for G-Hyprland to pick up, adding a practicalli.conf to the `~/.config/hypr/brain/config/monitor/` directory?

++Mod+Shift+"g" supposedly enables/disables G-Hyprland but I dont see anything that indicates the state.

++Mod+"S" is supposed to start the configuration tool for G-Hyprland (which seems to overrite any changes made manually)

> NOTE: G-Hyprland is working and as well as chainging all the config has introducted the nwg-bar, a sidebar that shows open desktop apps.

### Monitor configuration

Setting the monitor preferences first is important to ensure that fonts and layouts render correctly.

A single display, the monitor default configuration should work well, automatically setting the highest available resolution.

Multiple monitors will be treated as having the same resolution by waybar and other tools, meaning that the wwaybar may not fit if one display is much smaller than the other.

!!! NOTE "Report monitor configuration and save to file"
    ```shell
    hyprctl monitors > ~/backup/garudalinux/monitor-details.txt
    ```

Example setup

Dell 5k2k external monitor (51200x2160 pixels) connected to a laptop with an HD screen (1920x1080 pixels) has a significant disparity between display resolutions.

Create your own custom monitor configurations and include that in the `hyprland.conf`, or as a separate `monitor.conf` file that is included in `hyprland.conf`

!!! NOTE "Manual monitor settings"
    ```conf

### Visual tool to configure display

What is kanshi ?  It that the tool that runs when calling 'Displays' from the Hyprland desktop menu (Super + Space)

No.  `/usr/bin/wdisplays` is the visual tool to see the display size and orientations, from the 'Displays' menu.

Kanshi seems to be an automatic (re)load tool for configurations based on a profile.


??? EXAMPLE "kanshi manual page entry"
    ```shell-output
    ❯ man kanshi

    General Commands Manual

    NAME
           kanshi - dynamic output configuration

    SYNOPSIS
           kanshi [options...]

    OPTIONS
           -h, --help
               Show help message and quit.

           -c, --config <config>
               Specifies a config file.

           -l, --listen-fd <fd>
               Listen on the specified file descriptor for IPC.

    DESCRIPTION
           kanshi is a Wayland daemon that automatically configures outputs.

           kanshi is configured with a list of output profiles. Each profile contains a set of outputs. A profile will be automatically activated if all specified outputs are currently connected. A profile contains configuration for each output.

           If kanshi receives a SIGHUP signal, it will reread its config file.

    CONFIGURATION
           kanshi reads its configuration from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kanshi/config. If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config.

           An error is raised if no configuration file is found.

           For information on the configuration file format, see kanshi(5).``shell-output
    ```


### sftp connection for file sharing

I was trying to connect to Garuda Linux using the sftp protocol, used by Nautilus and other file managers to 'mount' a remote file system for reading and writing files.

The connection was refused by host initially, so it seems although openssh package was installed, the service was not running locally (or was being blocked by the firewall).

The sshd service needs to be started to be able to access the Arch Linux system using sftp.

!!! NOTE "Start the OpenSSH service"
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    ```

This is strange as I didnt seem to need this when using scp (maybe I was using that from the Arch Linux system).

I also added ssh to the firewall rules, but not sure if that was neccessary

!!! NOTE "Enable ssh in the ufw firewall"
    ```shell
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    ```

If an "unknown host" message is shown, there is likely an older identity in the `.ssh/known_hosts` file.  Move or delete the known_hosts file and the sftp connection will prompt if the new host identity should be accepted.

> NOTE: If the remote server has not changed, then make sure the connection is going to the correct computer (the identities in the known_hosts file blocks if the identity it knows is different).


### Thunar file manager

The thunar file manager is the default in Garuda Linux.  It has all the features I used from Nautilus more or less, including a network section where I can use sftp to copy or move files between computers on my local network.

The thunar preferences do not have a way to configure the font size.  I assume thunar is using the default font (which may be Fira Code 10 according to some gkt-3.0 settings I saw).

In Garuda Linux the font is too small to comfortably read the text, especially on the laptop display.

Scaling the list or icon view in thunar only scales the graphics and not the text (something that Nautilus does very well).

A specific font size can be set through a GTK-3.0 stylesheet (which didnt previously exist).  At the time of writing the CSS configuration should be done in GTK-3 and not GTK-4.

!!! NOTE "Set Thunar specific font size"
    ```css title="~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css"
    /* Set font size for thunar file manager */
    .thunar { font-size: 16pt }
    gtk-3.0/gtk.css (END)
    ```

Select 'Close all Windows' from the Thunar file manager app, or use the `-q` flag to quit all instances.

!!! NOTE "Close and restart thunar file manager"
    ```shell
    thunar -q && thunar
    ```

Now thunar should show in the font size of your choice.


### Music metadata

I have a library of digital sounds and music that is being converted to Opus. Not all of the files have meta data in the form of tags.

## Claude AI

Experiments with Claude AI, initially via the web site.

Claude has a free plan and paid plans.  The free plan only allows use via the Claude AI website or apps on Android/iOS.

The free plan does not allow use of an API key, which requires a $5 payment or a 13GBP / $20 dollar 'pro' subscription.

![Anthropic Claude AI plans comparison](){loading=lazy}


TODO: define the limits of the free plan, can it be used for ECA / clojure-mcp

!!! EXAMPLE "Initial Claude Welcome"
    ```shell-output
    Hey there, I’m Claude.

    I’m your AI assistant for brainstorming, creating, and learning together.

    Here’s a few things you should know about me:
    Curious? Just ask

    Chat with me about anything from simple asks to complex ideas! I’m always ready to help (literally).
    I’m built to help, never harm

    Automated safeguards protect our conversations from creating violent, abusive, or deceptive content.
    ```

Claude personalises the experience by asking 'what should I call you?'

The next part is where I get stuck.  What do I actually want to do with this AI?

```shell-output
All set! Here are a few ideas just for you.

Where should we start?

- Create a coding Easter egg that would make my team smile
- Build an app based on my idea
- Create dependency maps
```

I can also select to have my own topic.


### Dependency maps


```shell-output
Hi Claude! Could you create dependency maps? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to — like Google Drive, web search, etc. — if they’ll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational.

Please execute the task as soon as you can - an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!

I'd be happy to help you create dependency maps! To make sure I build exactly what you need, I have a couple of key questions:

    What type of dependencies are you mapping? (e.g., software components, project tasks, business processes, organizational teams, or something else?)
    What's the scope and complexity? (e.g., a small project with 5-10 items, or a large system with dozens of interconnected elements?)

Based on your answers, I can create an interactive visual dependency map as an artifact that will let you add, edit, and rearrange dependencies with drag-and-drop functionality.

If you have any existing documentation, lists, or files that outline the components and their relationships, feel free to upload them - that would definitely help me create a more accurate starting map for you!
