This week we have the pleasure of another heatwave in the United Kingdom.  Its not quite as extreme as the one in July (37 degrees Celsius), but it will in the 30 degree range again for several days.

The week started with a [cycle ride to collect some new shoes](https://www.strava.com/activities/15422423063).  In training for a ride up a mountain during a French trip I did two more ~100km rides back to back

- [The masochists route ride to Yalding](https://www.strava.com/activities/15456165586) (ascending some new hills along the way and extra hills on the way back)
- [112 Km ride to Box Hill](https://www.strava.com/activities/15467902479) was surprisingly good, I was more awake than the previous days ride.
- [Level 4 ride with Bigfoot CC](https://www.strava.com/activities/15476759131) was a good recovery ride, only 3 hours long and although hilly (all routes in Kent are) it felt a moderate 738 meters of climbing.

I use the Lake brand of shoes as they have a wide fit size.  Although going through there [very detailed sizing chart](https://uk.lakecycling.com/pages/sizing-chart) it was clear that not all shoes were wide enough for my feet (without being far too long).

## Cult SciFi movies

There were some very interesting [under-rated sci-fi movies from the 90's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc4ezofokY0) reviewed in a YouTube video from [YesterVerse](https://www.youtube.com/@YesterVerseYT)

## Open Source Creative tools

Practicalli uses the following creative tools:

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) to create logos, banners and any vector graphics (SVG - Scala Vector Graphics).  Inkscape can export Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files and many other image formats.

[Blender](https://blender.org) is currently used for video editing screen-cast content and long-distance cycling videos.  I have dabbled with 2D and 3D animation in Blender, but have quite limited experience so far.

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) is used to capture camera, screen and graphic overlay to create video content for screen-casts.


Creative tools to evaluate:

- [Friction](https://friction.graphics/) can be used to create animated graphics with vector (SVG) and raster graphic formats.  The page on [animation techniques](https://friction.graphics/documentation/animation_techniques.html) looks a valuable place to start exploring.

- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) is a non-linear video editing tool (Linux, macOS, BSD & Windows).

- [Glaxnimate](https://glaxnimate.org/) is a vector animation & motion design app.  It seems useful for generating animate images in SVG, WebP and GIF formats.


## Hyprland

More adventures in Hyprland this week with the Garuda Linux distribution that claims to make using Arch Linux more reliable.

After a `sudo garuda-update` this week the Hyprland desktop failed to load, showing only a blank screen after entering my username and password at the ssdm prompt.

This was an opportunity to understand how Garuda Linux uses the Btfs file system to create snapshots, making it simpler to role back to a good state.

It would be far easier to use Gnome or KDE desktop than Hyprland, but I do feel productive when using a tilling window manager.

### Recovering Garuda Linux

Garuda Linux creates a snapshot each time there is a system update, e.g. `sudo garuda-update` or installing a package `sudo pacman -Sy package-name`

It seems this is very useful when using a rolling distribution like Arch Linux, especially when using Hyprland which is prone to breaking changes as it and the projects are using are evolving quickly.

When the operating system or desktop is not running correctly, a snapshot can be chosen from the Grub boot menu.

This is the approach required to fix the issue I was experiencing, where the screen went blank after login via SSDM greeter screen.

I went through several snapshots before finding one that would load the desktop.  Garuda Linux prompted me to restore the snapshot, so I accepted.

It took about a minute to restore and then prompted to reboot the system.  Everything was back to normal after the reboot.

I was impressed with the simplicity of selecting snapshots and using them to recover to a previous state.  The hardest part was figuring out which snapshot to restore.  To minimise impact of restoring, start from the latest snapshot and then go backwards through the snapshot history, until a working snapshot is found.

The `snapper` desktop tool shows the snapshot history and also allows a specific snapshot to be restored or deleted if no longer needed.

TODO: gain an understating of how much space each snapshot is taking up.


### Playing videos

I use [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to play music and videos across all my computers and mobile devices (tablets & smartphones).

I prefer using the following digital formats:

- [Opus open source audio codec](https://opus-codec.org/) - 128bit for very high quality, 96bit for music and 48bit for spoken word (audio books, podcasts, etc).  Audio within YouTube videos and YouTube Music use Opus, within the [WebM multimedia container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebM).
- H.254 video encoding
- [Matroska multimedia container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska) can contain video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks within a single file

> NOTE: I have been testing WebM but that seems slower to encode when using Blender. Further testing needed.
> NOTE: Previously I used Vorbis codec but files were replace using the Opus codec which is much more efficient.  The Opus codec creates audio files of far higher quality whist keeping file sizes very small.

Arch Linux has a [vlc package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/vlc/) and a [vlc-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vlc-git) package.

The vlc-git package is build with Wayland compositor support by default.  The vlc package uses Xwayland (Wayland support is currently broken).

The vlc package has a minimal set of codecs, so vlc-git package should be used to support a wide range of video and audio formats.

[VLC Media Player - Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VLC_media_player){target=_blank .md-button}

### Screenshots

There doesnt seem to be a good tool to create desktop screenshots.

The hyprland community seems to use [grim]() or [grimblast]().  I assume there is some relation there, but still investigating.

!!! NOTE "Copy a screenshot from a region"
    Create a copy of a region as a screenshot that can be pasted into another application, e.g. GIMP or Inkscape.

    ```shell
    grimblast copy area
    ```

!!! NOTE "Save a screenshot from a region to a file"
    Save a region as a screenshot to a file.

    ```shell
    grimblast save area
    ```

> NOTE: Did I need to install grimblast package or had it already been included in another dependency ?


I use [flameshot]() but that doesnt work with wayland.

Gnome desktop has an okay tool, but not as good as flameshot.  I dont know what that tool is called, so I will have to search to find the package name for Arch Linux.  It is possible that it has a bunch of dependencies and pulls in lots of Gnome things I dont need.

I havent use KDE for a while, so not sure what kind of screenshot tool it provides.


### Fish environment variables

Unlike Bash and Zsh, the Fish shell uses the `set` command to set a variable.

!!! EXAMPLE "Set a variable for fish shell"
    ```shell title="~/.fish_profile"
    set variable_name value
    ```

Use the -x flag to export an environment variable so other tools can use that variable.  `set -x` is the equivalent of `export` in Bash and Zsh.

!!! EXAMPLE "Export environment variable in fish shell"
    ```shell title="~/.fish_profile"
    set -x PRACTICALLI_NONELS_CONFIG
    ```

### Waybar

[:fontawesome-brands-github: waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar){target=_blank} is a highly customizable Wayland bar for Sway and Wlroots based compositors, .e.g Hyprland.

Garuda Linux Hyprland edition provides a really rich waybar customisation

From right to left:

- power (sleep, reboot, shutdown, etc.)
- date & time
- something I can enable / disable ??
- connectivity (network, bluetooth)
- network status (IP address, up/down usage)
- sound device and volume control (scroll with mouse)
- battery (percentage charge)
- disk / file system used
- CPU usage in percentage (includes virtual cores) - click opens 'htop' command in the foot terminal, close with ++"q"++
- Temperature of hardware - degrees Celsius
- Key binding cheat sheet popup when clicked
- monitor brightness as percentage - mouse wheel changes brightness
- Packages updates - number of packages - enter password to run the update or ++ctrl+"c"++ to cancel
- network traffic (possibly superfluous as the network status also shows this information on hover)

!!! WARNING "Foot terminal - breaking change"
    When clicking on the package update, the foot terminal showed a depreciated message
    ```shell
    deprecated: foot: cursor.color: use colors.cursor instead
    ```

The  waybar for the laptop display is too big and doesnt fit the screen size.  A specific monitor configuration for each display seems prudent.

<!-- TODO: discover how to create a configuration for each monitor -->


### Monitor configuration

`hyprctl` can be used to generate information about the system

!!! NOTE "Show current monitor configuration"
    ```shell
    hyprctrl monitors
    ```

!!! EXAMPLE "Lenovo T14S with Dell 5k2 monitor configuration"
    ```shell-output
    ❯ hyprctl monitors

## Neovim

I use a few different rules for [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) tool which enhances the readability of the content I write for the Practicalli books and articles.

- longer lines for paragraphs
- allow 2 blank lines between content
- allow several html tags to support embedding YouTube videos


### Markdownlint local config

Lint and format tools are installed by Mason and use a default configuration.

None-ls plugin can be configured to use a custom configuration for one or more of the lint and format tools.

If `PRACTICALLI_NONELS_CONFIG` is not set to true (or not set at all) then the configuration is skipped, returning an empty table, `{}`, which is merged into the whole config.

!!! EXAMPLE "Conditionally load config based on environment variable"
    ```lua
    -- INFO: Config in this file skipped if `PRACTICALLI_NONELS_CONFIG` environment variable is not set to true
    local nonels_config = vim.env.PRACTICALLI_NONELS_CONFIG
    if nonels_config ~= "true" then return {} end
    ```

!!! EXAMPLE "Use local config file for MarkdownLint"
    ```lua
    ---@type LazySpec
    return {
      -- use mason-lspconfig to configure LSP installations
      -- use mason-null-ls to configure Formatters/Linter installation for null-ls sources
      {
        "jay-babu/mason-null-ls.nvim",
        -- overrides `require("mason-null-ls").setup(...)`
        opts = function(_, opts)
          -- add more things to the ensure_installed table protecting against community packs modifying it
          opts.ensure_installed = require("astrocore").list_insert_unique(opts.ensure_installed, {
            "markdownlint",
            -- add more arguments for adding more null-ls sources
          })
          opts.handlers = {
            markdownlint = function(source_name, methods)
              local null_ls = require "null-ls"
              null_ls.register(null_ls.builtins.diagnostics.markdownlint.with {
                -- extra_args = { "--config", "~/.config/markdownlint.yaml" },
                extra_args = { "--config", "~/.config/markdown-lint.jsonc" },
              })
            end,
          }
        end,
      },
    }
    ```

## AI Thoughts

The ever expanding range of AI services often feels like the "gold rush" that occurred in 1848 in California.

> NOTE: The 'Streaming Wars' South Park episodes are a similar analogy.

Whilst I believe some form of AI services will become a helpful part of our working lives, there are many years of maturity for these tools ahead.

As with any gold rush, there will be those that make large amounts of money and those that loose a lot of money.  AI is a high risk environment until it has chance to mature.

At some point over the next few years the AI bubble will burst (and perhaps this is already happening).  There continues to be a rapid growth of AI tools and services and I assume this  rapid growth will continue for many years more (for as long as people can get investment).

Rapid growth always causes a 'bubble' and eventually there will be a conflation of products and companies in this space.  As there is such a wide scope for AI services, then its likely to see multiple bubbles at various levels of rapid growth and stagnation.

The negative part of the potential of AI are the people trying to cash in on other peoples lack of understanding.  Thoughts of AI being seen as a silver bullet by some falling for the hype are concerning.

A larger concern is where people start to believe AI is omniscient and making serious decisions without critical thinking on the information the AI produces.
