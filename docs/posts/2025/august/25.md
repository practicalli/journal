A little less cycling this week so I can rest the muscles in my legs (which have noticably grown).  I will focus more on weights, walking and most importantly streatching, i.e. yoga.

I [continue to use Garuda Linux Hyprland variant](https://garudalinux.org) as my daily operating system.  Hyprland has always felt a very natural to use, especially coming from i3 with Regolith Desktop.

## Garuda Linux

I am becoming more comfortable and trusting of Garuda Linux, expecially as it is running on the computer hardware I use the most.

### OS Snapshots

By default Garuda Linux formats the disc partition for the operating system using Btrfs, a modern copy on write (COW) file system for Linux providing advanced fault tolerance, file system repair and administration.

Using BtrFS allows Garuda Linux to take regular snapshots of the OS before important changes are made, e.g. when adding, removing or updating Arch Linux packages.

Snapshots are managed by the Garuda Linux BTFS Assistant, which shows the history of snapshots taken.

![Garuda Linux Btrfs assistant](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/hyprland/garuda-linux-btrfs-assistant.png?raw=true){loading=lazy}

This tool is also useful when you see a notification about older snapshots.

![Garuda Linux Notification - Btrfs old snapshots found](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/hyprland/garuda-linux-snapshots-old-notification.png?raw=true){loading=lazy}

Garuda Linux also provides a boot option to restore operating system snapshots, means that even when the I cant login to Hyprland or Arch packages break I can restore to a previously working snapshot right from the boot menu.  It is important to remember to delete older snapshots when not required, especially when running low on file space.


There is still a lot to learn and as much to try out, although there feels like very few obstacles remaining (famous last words).

There are minor aspects such as taking a screen grab which feel a bit basic (compared to flameshot on Debian Linux).


### Video player

[VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/) is excellent for playing many different video and audio formats ([codecs and containers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Codecs_and_containers)).

I have use VLC on Debian Linux and Android for many years and haven't found any formats it could not playback well.

On Garuda (Arch) Linux I have had several playback issues.  The [VLC Arch package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/vlc/) is a 'split' package and only include a sub-set of codecs

The [VLC-git AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vlc-git) is a monolithic version of the VLC package from the latest commit, including all codecs and plugins. Unfortunately this version of VLC seems less reliable, especially playing files from a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. VLC-git does not show on-screen display in Garuda Linux Hyprland (not sure if VLC does either).

### Music tags

Puddletag is a useful desktop tool for adding and modifying tags on digital music.

I use it to:

- add year and genre to music
- add meta data tags for music song titles, track number, album and artist, usually from the file names.

A pattern can be used to derive meta data from the file name of each song to update that files tag.

I added a custom pattern in `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Patterns` that expresses a common pattern for all my music files.

!!! NOTE "Custom file name pattern used with Puddletag"
    ```regex
    %track% %title% - %album% - %artist%
    ```

In the Puddletag Patterns list, I changed the sort order so this custom pattern is at the top and therefore automatically used.


> NOTE: On Debian Linux I use Ex Falso which is a very nice music tag editor and I find simple to use

!!! HINT "Challenges tagging WebM containers"
    Although the WebM container is a derivative of the well established Matraskov container, ExFalso and other tag tools do not seem to work with this format.


### Material for MkDocs

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is an important environment to establish within Arch Linux if I am to continue using Garuda Linux.

The Practicalli books and websites all include the following information, tested out on a Debian Linux operating system

<!-- TODO: Include the setup of a python virtual environment -->

#### Local development

Install mkdocs version 9 using the Python pip package manager

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material=="9.5"
```

Install the plugins used by the Practicalli site using Pip (these are also installed in the GitHub Action workflow)

```shell
pip3 install mkdocs-material mkdocs-callouts mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-redirects pillow cairosvg
```

> pillow and cairosvg python packages are required for [Social Cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/)

Fork the GitHub repository and clone that fork to your computer,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account>/<repository>.git
```

Run a local server from the root of the cloned project

```shell
make docs
```

The website will open at <http://localhost:8000>

If making smaller changes, then only rebuild the content that changes, speeding up the local development process

```shell
make docs-changed
```

> NOTE: navigation changes may not be correctly reflected without reloading the page in the web browser or carrying out a full `make docs` build


### Floating windows

Thunar file manager has popup windows that should be set to float

!!! EXAMPLE "Show details of currently open windows"
```shell-output

!!! NOTE "Set float for rename and file transfer progress"

TODO: try this

```config
windowrule = float, initialClass: thunar, title: Rename: .*
windowrule = float, initialClass: thunar, title: File Operation Progress: .*
```

If that doesnt work, try this

```config
windowrule = float, title:(Rename.*)$
windowrule = float, title:(File Operation Progress.*)$
```

Windowrule version 2 seems to work although I dont like the position (center of current display)

```config
windowrule = float,class:^(thunar)$,title:(Rename.*)$
windowrule = float,class:^(thunar)$,title:(File Operation Progress.*)$
```

### G-Hyprland

G-Hyprland is an optional tool in Garuda Linux, used to customise the hyprland configuration (monitors, tiling windows, etc) and select waybar themes.

Install...


++Super+"s"+ starts the G-Hyprland tool and shows a menu.

TODO: insert menu

++Super+"w"+ reloads the configuration and updates the hyprland desktop.

I added a monitor > practicalli.config setup for the Lenovo AMD laptop & Dell 5k2k monitor.

#### Waybar

I prefer the `default` waybar theme as it includes the number on each desktop.

There are some items on the default theme that I do not use, so ideally I will customise it and create a `themes` > `practicalli.config` variant.


### Wallpapers

Garuda Linux uses [wpaperd](https://github.com/danyspin97/wpaperdhttps://github.com/danyspin97/wpaperd), which dynamically changes wallpaper

The [Wallpaper Archive for Linux window managers and desktops](https://github.com/santoshxshrestha/wallpaper-archive){target=_blank} has an excellent collection of backgrounds for the desktop, including animated images.

After cloning the repository I browsed the dynamic wallpapers to see which I liked, using the thunar file browser and pressing enter on each file. The file launches in mpv Movie Player as that was the last application used to view video.

`.config/wpaperd/config.toml` has a weird location as the default directory, $HOME/custom-wallpaper.  I updated the directory location inside the `~/Pictures/` directory.

```toml
[default]
path = "~/Pictures/wallpaper/hyprland/
transition-time = 600
duration = '10 m'
```

I believe the operating system needs to be rebooted or at least logout of the desktop session.
