Updated the command line prompt to [:anchor: Starship.rs](#starship-command-prompt-theme) due to an [:anchor: issue with Powerline10k](#linux-shell-hanging).

Starship works very well and is fairly simple to configure using a `~/.config/starship.toml` file.  There is a [:globe_with_meridians: Catppuccin Powerline Preset](https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline) (theme) that [:fontawesome-brands-github: was customised](https://github.com/practicalli/dotfiles/blob/main/starship.toml) to move some information onto the right-hand side of the prompt and tweaked some of the default Catppuccin Mocha colors.

MkDocs is used for all Practicalli websites and something has changed so that [:anchor: running a local website fails to build](#mkdocs-issues).  This does make using MkDocs a little more fiddly to use.  If I dont use embedded files in a code block then everything seems okay again.

This week I have been volunteering at [:anchor: Devoxx UK in London](#devoxx-uk). Tuesday was setting up activates for the event, such as building video game cabinets. Wednesday and Thursday was room monitor, ensuring the speakers and attendees are taken care of.  The room monitor also captures feedback about the event back to the conference organisers (so they can continue optimising the conference for next year).

## Linux shell hanging

After a package upgrade on Debian Linux today the shell was hanging when running both Gnome terminal and Kitty terminal.

A little searching and thinking the root cause was the `nordvpn` package conflicting with the Powerline10k shell prompt theme.

Removing the `~/.zshrc` symbolic link removed the conflict as it was no longer loading the Powerline10k theme.  Unfortunately that also stopped all the other Zsh features I used from [:fontawesome-brands-github: Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

The [:ticket: issue was reported via the Powerline10k repository](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/issues/2860).

As I no longer use NordVPN service, I removed the `nordvpn` package.

```shell
apt remove --purge nordvpn
```

## Starship command prompt theme

A notice was added to the [:fontawesome-brands-github: Powerline10k repository](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) saying that the project is no longer actively maintained.  As there is also an issue with NordVPN, then its time to try another theme.

A good friend suggested [:globe_with_meridians: Starship](https://starship.rs/) as an alternative.

The default theme was a little simplistic for me although there are several alternative 'presets'.  As I am now using the Catppuccin theme for the Kitty terminal and was using Powerline10k as the command prompt, then [:globe_with_meridians: Catppuccin Powerline Preset](https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline) seems to be the ideal choice.


!!! NOTE "Starship Debian Linux package install"
    ```shell
    apt install starship
    ```

The powerline10k theme was removed from the Prezto configuration, not setting any theme (otherwise starship does not show).

Add the starship init script at the end of the `.zshrc` file

!!! NOTE "Starship init script for zsh"
    ```shell title=`~/.zshrc`
    eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    ```

There is a configuration to generate the `.toml` configuration file for the catppuccin-powerline preset, but this didnt not find the theme (perhaps the Debian Linux package is not new enough).

!!! NOTE "Generate Starship config file using catppuccin-powerline preset"
    ```shell
    starship preset catppuccin-powerline -o ~/.config/starship.toml
    ```

!!! EXAMPLE "Output: generate starship config file"
    ```shell-session
    ‚ùØ starship preset catppuccin-powerline -o ~/.config/starship.toml
    error: invalid value 'catppuccin-powerline' for '[NAME]'
      [possible values: bracketed-segments, gruvbox-rainbow, jetpack, nerd-font-symbols, no-empty-icons, no-nerd-font, no-runtime-versions, pastel-powerline, plain-text-symbols, pure-preset, tokyo-night]

    For more information, try '--help'.

    NOTE:
        passed arguments: ["preset", "catppuccin-powerline", "-o", "/home/practicalli/.config/starship.toml"]
    ```

The web page has a link to the `.toml` file for the catppuccin-powerline preset, but the link is broken üîó

A search on the GitHub repo found the [`catppuccin-powerline.toml` file](https://github.com/starship/starship/blob/master/docs/public/presets/toml/catppuccin-powerline.toml).  This was copied to `~/.config/starship.toml` file.

Opening a new terminal session in Kitty used the catppuccin-powerline preset and it looks quite nice.

### Customise catppuccin theme

Unlike powerline10k which splits less important information to the right-hand side of the prompt, Starship has all the elements from the left-hand side.  This makes for potentially quite long prompt.

`format` controls the layout of the prompt.  `right_format` was added, moving the command duration, time, username and operating system details here from the left-hand side.

??? EXAMPLE "Custom Command Line prompt layout"
    ```toml
    "$schema" = 'https://starship.rs/config-schema.json'

    format = """
    [ÓÇ∂](peach)\
    $directory\
    [ÓÇ∞](bg:yellow fg:peach)\
    $git_branch\
    $git_status\
    [ÓÇ∞](fg:yellow bg:green)\
    $c\
    $haskell\
    $java\
    $kotlin\
    $nodejs\
    $python\
    $rust\
    [ÓÇ¥ ](fg:green)\
    $line_break\
    $character"""

    right_format = """
    $cmd_duration\
    [ÓÇ∂](white)\
    $time\
    [ÓÇ∞](fg:white bg:mauve )\
    $username\
    [ÓÇ∞](fg:mauve bg:mauve )\
    $os\
    [ÓÇ¥ ](mauve)"""

    continuation_prompt = '‚ñ∂‚ñ∂ '
    ```

Component styles had the colors tweaked using the existing definitions in `[palettes.catppuccin_mocha]`

![Practicalli Customisation of catppuccin-powerline preset](https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/command-line/starship-cli-preset-catppuccin-custom.png?raw=true)

??? EXAMPLE "Update os and username colors"
    ```toml
    [os]
    disabled = false
    style = "bg:mauve fg:crust"

    [username]
    show_always = true
    style_user = "bg:mauve fg:crust"
    style_root = "bg:mauve fg:crust"
    format = '[ $user]($style)'
    ```

## MkDocs issues

After a package update `apt update && apt upgrade` I have some issues when running a local server for this journal, created with Material for MkDocs.

The same issue occurred once during the Continuous Integration workflow to build the site.

The issue seems to be intermittent and could be a simple issue of the local server being hammered too much.

I will keep testing to see if this is a short-term blip or a more serious issue.  I didn't see relative issues or pull requests on the [mkdocs-material repository](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material).

!!! INFO "Update on Error 429"
    Several embedded files were causing errors in the Journal website when using `mkdocs serve`.  This is happening on other computers so the actual cause is not that easy to track.

    The short-team solution is to replace any of those embedded file code blocks with the actual content of the files.

Updating the footer in 3rd Feb post fixed that issue.  Updating `%practicalli` to `#practicalli` fixed the link.

I assume that MkDocs local server is better and finding issues in the text now and picking up on issues that I have not noticed previously.

After fixing those issues, I experienced a further issue

## Devoxx UK

![Devoxx UK 2025 banner](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Theme-header-mobile-3.png){align=right loading=lazy style="width:240px"}

It was very rewarding and enjoyable to volunteer for Devoxx UK this year.  It has been many years since I was involved due to my health challenges, but it felt very natural and familiar.

On Tuesday I helped build the cabinets for video arcade games although I didnt get chance to play as there were many other setup tasks.

Wednesday and Thursday afternoons I was a room monitor, ensuring the speakers had everything they needed and that attendees were in the right talks.

In the mornings I took the opportunity to watch some great talks and catch up with friends I had not seen face to face in a long time.

On Friday afternoon I was on registration desk and since it was almost the end of the conference it was mainly reprinting or fixing badges and collecting lanyards for recycling for those leaving a little early.  I also packed up the registration desk and actually started planning that straight away so it took very little time to do at the end of the day.  I have almost everything packed a couple of hours before the end of my shift.

Before I left I helped out with packing up the sponsor area and arranged space in the loading bay for one of the sponsors who had been let down by the courier.

### Favourite talks

- Disney Driven Development
- Beyond Inspiration: Turning Learning into Action
- The history of Computer Art
- Demoscene: The Golden Years showing graphic demos made on early home computers
- Reading Code
- Understanding probabilistic data structures with 112,092 UFO Sightings
- Application Security - Consistency is everything
- Writing Greener Software Even When You Are Stuck On-Prem

There were more on Friday but I havent had time to add them.

Thank you.
