Updated [Practicalli Johnny GitHub Profile](https://github.com/practicalli-johnny) to include an available for hire button.  Updated the summary of roles to include more recent experiences, especially around technical leadership.

Practicalli books and blogs use [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for publishing to GitHub and its been very solid. I was surprised to experience [a local build issue](#mkdocs) at the start of the week.  An update of Material for MkDocs via Pip resolved the issue.

The [Publish Book GitHub CI Workflow](#publishing-ci-workflow) was pinned to a specific version.  The `publish-book.yaml` file has been updated to use the latest version.

Started adding a [Scheduled stale check](#scheduled-stale-check) CI workflow to all the Practicalli GitHub repositories.

Added [GitHub Issue types](#github-issue-types) to the Practicalli Organisation to help priorities and organise work.

## MkDocs

Practicalli book sites stopped building today as I was backing up projects on a laptop.

Running `make docs` task was showing errors with zip unable to extract a file.

A quick internet search discovered issues related to downloading Google fonts (or any fonts) for the Social pages (images to use when sharing links, i.e. on slack or social media tools).

The update of Material for MkDocs resolved the issue and I continued with my backup and a new [Practicalli Git](https://practical.li/git) book was deployed.


### Publishing CI Workflow

Reviewing the publishing workflow the mkdocs-material package was pinned to `"9.5.44"` (this was done a long time ago to resolve another issue that I have forgotten about - before I was creating a regular journal).


```config
      - run: pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-callouts mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-rss-plugin pillow cairosvg
```

## Scheduled Stale Check

Adding a GitHub workflow that uses the stale action, checking the repository for issues and pull requests that have not been updated after 45 days.

A start date of April 2025 was set to avoid closing lots of existing issues, whist I do a review of issues in each of the Practicalli repositories.

??? EXAMPLE "Practicalli Scheduled Stale Check"
    ```yaml
    # ----------------------------------------
    # Scheduled stale issue & pull request check
    #
    # Adds 'stale' label after a set piece of time,
    # then closes stale issues & pull requests a short period after
    #
    # Using "Close Stale Issues" action
    # https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues
    # ----------------------------------------

    name: 'Scheduled stale check'
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
      schedule:
        - cron: '30 1 * * *'

    jobs:
      stale:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "🚀 Job automatically triggered by ${{ github.event_name }}"
          - run: echo "🐧 Job running on ${{ runner.os }} server"
          - run: echo "🐙 Using ${{ github.ref }} branch from ${{ github.repository }} repository"

          - uses: actions/stale@v9
            with:
              stale-issue-message: 'After 30 days with no activity, the issue was automatically marked stale. Remove stale label or add a comment to prevent the issue being closed in 5 days.'
              stale-pr-message: 'After 45 days with no activity, the Pull Request was automatically marked stale. Remove stale label or comment to prevent the PR being closed in 10 days.'
              close-issue-message: 'This issue was closed because it has been stalled for 5 days with no activity.'
              close-pr-message: 'This PR was closed because it has been stalled for 10 days with no activity.'
              days-before-issue-stale: 30
              days-before-pr-stale: 45
              days-before-issue-close: 5
              days-before-pr-close: 10
              start-date: '2025-04-05T00:00:00Z' # only affect issues/PRs from date created (ISO 8601 or RFC 2822 format)
              any-of-labels: 'future,keep' # labels to keep
              exempt-issue-assignees: 'practicalli-johnny'
              exempt-pr-assignees: 'practicalli-johnny'

          # Summary
          - run: echo "🎨 Issues & Pull Request checked with actions/stale"
          - run: echo "🍏 Job status is ${{ job.status }}."
    ```


## GitHub Issue Types

GitHub projects come with **Task** **Bug** and **Feature** issue types by default.

Visit the Org _Settings_ > _Planning_ > _Issue Types_ page to create a new issue type and manage existing types.
