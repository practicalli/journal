I have been very busy working on the [Practicalli Astro 5 config](https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5) so I havent been updating this journal as often.  Lots of commits on GitHub though.

I did have a small issue [updating to Neovim 0.11 on Arch Linux](#arch-linux) which is now resolved, so I can relax on the sofa with the 'vintage' laptop and update the journal in comfort.

## Arch Linux

I wanted to install Neovim 0.11 and its been a few weeks since I used Arch Linux, so decided to update all packages


```shell
sudo pacman -Syu
```

This didnt include the latest neovim 0.11 package and included only two updates, so that seemed very suspicious as there is normally many more packages to update.

I tried the specific install of neovim, but that still showed 0.10.4 as the latest version of neovim package.

After a quick search on the internet, one suggestion was a problem with a mirror.  Arch Linux seems to have quite a few mirrors for a region (I am in the United Kingdom region).

The `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` contains the URL for each mirror site in the region.  I edited the file and commented the first two URLs (for the same server)

```shell
 sudo nvim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

Now running the package manager update I get around 30 packages listed with newer versions.  Rather than install them all, I just installed neovim 0.11

```shell
sudo pacman -Sy neovim
```

This worked and I am enjoying Neovim with the new Practicalli nvim-astro5 configuration.
