I will capture lessons learned from my experiences (and others) and my current thinking on how to resolve issues that I encountered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Updated &lt;code&gt;:format/cljfmt-check&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:format/cljfmt-fix&lt;/code&gt; aliases in &lt;a href=&#34;#clojure&#34;&gt;Practicalli Clojure CLI Config&lt;/a&gt; to use the newer publishing name for the library. The older &lt;code&gt;cljfmt&lt;/code&gt; name did not have a domain, so &lt;code&gt;cljfmt/cljfmt&lt;/code&gt; had to be used as the name when using Clojure CLI. The library published as &lt;code&gt;cljfmt&lt;/code&gt; stopped being updated at versino 0.9.2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started a page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/engineering-playbook/os/tui/&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Terminal User Interface (TUI) apps&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} in the Operating System section of Practicalli Engineering Playbook. I have been using an increasing number of TUI apps, especially after I began using Neovim. I also like apps that are completely keyboard driven, as I am a fast and effective typist and find the mouse very fiddly these days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/book-template&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub template repository&lt;/a&gt; to quickly create a new Practicalli book or blog web site, using Material for MkDocs. This template repo was used to create &lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli-engineering-manager&#34;&gt;Practicalli Engineering Manger repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking, pull-ups and weights are this weeks approach to building up my health again after a few weeks of flu.

I still have sore ears and swollen throat and more tired than normal. I am however getting a lot more sleep and not feeling as ill as previous episodes with covid. I have become very experience with managing this condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am applying for engineering manager roles again, a couple of companies a week, mainly through job adverts on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am also posting on LinkedIn on the topic of &#39;AI&#39;, trying to include pragmatic conversations around what the (completely overhyped technology) is actually useful for and what people are currently doing with it. It is interesting that through all the hype around 70% of people using &#39;AI&#39; are not using it for work. Maybe all those recent cat pictures on the internet are fakes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I continue to find &lt;a href=&#34;#downsizing&#34;&gt;things in my life that I can let go of&lt;/a&gt;, making more space in my house and easing a move to a new location when the time is right. I had forgotten how challenging it is to actually deal with cash nowadays, although I was able to deposit almost all of my coins in my bank account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOTE: the title of this post is a reference to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Reality_(Red_Dwarf)&#34;&gt;&#34;Back to Reality&#34; episode of Red Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;.

I didn&#39;t see any reports about this issue, but something has changed that broke a working OBS. A rollback of the Btrfs snapshots via the Garuda Linux boot menu restored to a working version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editing the video of the &lt;a href=&#34;#cycling&#34;&gt;cycling trip to Grain in August 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its Covid season again and I must scale down my cycling as I have an infection. I did manage a ride on Monday and Wednesday, but on Wednesday evening I had a very bad dizzy spell and uncontrollable shaking for 30 minutes. I couldnt really move and would have called for an ambulance had my phone been in reach. It took a few days to feel okay again, but my energy levels are still feeling compromised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A break from cycling will be hard as it has significantly helped improve my health. Instead I will rely on walks in the park, at least 1 hour every day (unless its raining all day). I managed a 2 hour walk on Friday to attend a blood test, although was too tired to walk on Saturday. I will endeavour to go for a walk mid-day on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/upgrades-break-often-with-arch-linux/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 21:23:38 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/upgrades-break-often-with-arch-linux/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/october/06.png" type="image/png" length="58353" /> </item> <item> <title>Darker days</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>cycling</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;The days are starting to get shorter. Time to start getting up earlier :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year continues to been filled with many dark days across our society of human beings. Selfishness seems abound, driven by fear created by the few to manipulate the many. The ever increasing propaganda seems to know no end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you are put into a position of constant fear of the other, you are loosing a party of your humanity and missing out in the multitude of joys in our world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is easy to forget that these hostile views are from a vocal minority who really do not understand the damage they are doing to our society and themselves. Unfortunately they also impact the lives of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One regular tonne from those in fear is that they are loosing their identity because of others. How can this be the case when each person&#39;s identity is shaped by so many active and passive experiences. Fear shuts down the intricacies of each persons identity. Prolonged fear reduces a person to a mindless savage, capable of unbelievable hate towards others (and themselves).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movement of people has been the bedrock of human survival and evolution over the last 10,000 years. To think this would ever stop is to deny a significant part of our society. Went people are welcomed into a society, they contribute and become part of a richer society. When we fail to all welcome people into our society then people do not feel they can become a part of our world. When a vocal minority throws hate or even bricks, then not only those on the receiving end feel hurt, our whole society is greatly damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cold and foggy start to a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/15975743263&#34;&gt;112 km ride on Monday&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} which brightened up just over half way. I had lots of layers on, including 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of gloves. Surprisingly I managed quite a few personal best times along the route. I thought we were going quite steady.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was quite exhausted on Tuesday though, I seem to have some covid or flu symptoms affecting me and draining my energy. I will start doing deliberate breathing to help keep my lungs clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wednesday was a big organisation and tidy up of the house, as a plumber is coming to service the boiler on Thursday. I gave away the last of the IKEA 365+ food containers I bought a long time ago. The containers always felt a bit top-heavy (they are tapered with a small base). I posted them on Freegle at the weekend and after one person didnt turn up, another came on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thursday the boiler was serviced and I also arranged a service for my neighbour (who looks after my cats). One of the people I cycle with is a plumber, so its nice to have someone I can trust looking at the boiler. My boiler is in very good condition, which is nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saturday I was helping my neighbour identify the cause of a vibration with their central heating system. After around 45 minutes of heating the radiators, the boiler was creating a very loud vibration. This vibration occurred every 5 minutes or so, for about 30 seconds. I bled the radiators, a couple of which did have a lot of air in. The issue remained. After a bit of a hunt the water pressure&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/darker-days/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 23:39:49 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/darker-days/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/september/29.png" type="image/png" length="43547" /> </item> <item> <title>A brave new world</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>hyprland</category> <category>lazyvim</category> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Another 3 cycle rides in a row this week, covering 256 km distance for the week.

I plan to cuddle up with &lt;a href=&#34;#omarchy&#34;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I continue to use &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Garuda Linux&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=&#34;#hyprland&#34;&gt;Hyprland &amp;amp; Wayland&lt;/a&gt; based system on my main computer and it is an enjoyable experience athough there has been quite a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the huge push for &#39;AI&#39; services over the last year has been mostly hype I have dismissed much of it. To evaluate if there is any value in the current &#39;AI&#39; tools I&#39;ve started considering &lt;a href=&#34;#ai-in-reality&#34;&gt;how I gather and organise information&lt;/a&gt;, to find opportunities for optimisation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downsizing my life continues with my older bicycles and accessories being recycled or upcycled. I am also investigating where are &lt;a href=&#34;https://mynextbike.co.uk/blogs/selling/where-to-sell-your-used-bike&#34;&gt;effective places to sell my bicycle&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank}.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sigmasports.com/item/Cannondale/Quick-Carbon-1-Hybrid-Bike-2018/H9PS&#34;&gt;Cannondale Quick Carbon Hybrid bike&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018 for commuting into London (42 minutes was my fastest time into London, this was before the cycle super-highways).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cyclinguk.org/article/how-sell-your-cycle&#34;&gt;Cycling UK&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} has tips on selling a bicycle. There is also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.cyclinguk.org/viewforum.php?f=40&amp;amp;sid=726ba7097434b089f0927cf7cf87d0cc&#34;&gt;For Sale Forum&lt;/a&gt;. I have posted my Cannondale hybrid bike on this forum to see if there is interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bikedelivery.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Bike Delivery&lt;/a&gt; provides a delivery service for 42.99 GBP, with a further 19.99 GBP for a cardboard box to pack the bike in. 100 GBP liability insurance is free, 14.99 GBP for cover up to 500 GBP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will still have 3 bicycles left after I sell one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a much greater appreciation for a simpler life over the last few years (since Covid). I will focus on a small number of things I value deeply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This simplification lightens my mental load and enables focus on the things I really value. It will also be far easier to relocate, should I find a new place to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sounds like the HMRC is swampped with self-assessment returns. According to the Gov.uk website it will be 44th November by the time they process and reply to my self-assessment submission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gov.uk website has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-when-you-can-expect-a-reply-from-hmrc&#34;&gt;check the status&lt;/a&gt; where an estimated date will be shown. along with the current submissions date being processed (16th May). It may be worth checking again in a few weeks to see if HMRC has got faster or slower.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/a-lighter-load/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2025 20:27:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/a-lighter-load/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/september/15.png" type="image/png" length="44110" /> </item> <item> <title>Adventures in Hyprland and France</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>cycling</category> <category>hyprland</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;The nights are getting darker but that means more chance for star gazing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli&#34;&gt;Monthly updates&lt;/a&gt; for practicalli projects, updating dependencies on the Clojure CLI Config and Project Templates repositories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testing out &lt;a href=&#34;#cycling&#34;&gt;new toys for the bicycle&lt;/a&gt;, including an electric pump, RideNow TPU inner tubes and Continental Gran Prix 5000 cream &amp;amp; black tyres.

In training for a ride up a mountain during a French trip I did two more ~100km rides back to back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/15456165586&#34;&gt;The masochists route ride to Yalding&lt;/a&gt; (ascending some new hills along the way and extra hills on the way back)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/15467902479&#34;&gt;112 Km ride to Box Hill&lt;/a&gt; was surprisingly good, I was more awake than the previous days ride.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/15476759131&#34;&gt;Level 4 ride with Bigfoot CC&lt;/a&gt; was a good recovery ride, only 3 hours long and although hilly (all routes in Kent are) it felt a moderate 738 meters of climbing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I use the Lake brand of shoes as they have a wide fit size. Although going through there &lt;a href=&#34;https://uk.lakecycling.com/pages/sizing-chart&#34;&gt;very detailed sizing chart&lt;/a&gt; it was clear that not all shoes were wide enough for my feet (without being far too long).&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/another-heatwave/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 19:22:23 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/another-heatwave/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/august/11.png" type="image/png" length="44682" /> </item> <item> <title>Is AI worth the cost</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenAI gives a curl command to initially test the account setup, then its nothing until a credit card is added to the account.

As I had been using SID packages, then the Debian Linux system had become a little too unstable for day to day use. Interestingly I installed the KDE desktop and that worked very nicely before I started again from scratch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyperland is kept up to date in Arch Linux although there is a lot more work to learn and maintain arch linux compared to Debian Linux. pacman command options are quite cryptic and I found them hard to memorise. Its also easy to break things doing an update (the downside of a rolling release based distribution).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#garuda-linux&#34;&gt;Garuda Linux&lt;/a&gt; adds some nice tools on top of Arch Linux (and can also used the Nix sub-system) to simplify overall package upgrades and a range of other maintenance tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca-nvim&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: editor-code-assistant/eca-nvim&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} project via testing and feedback. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/editor-code-assistant/eca-nvim/pull/2&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: Contributed a plugin spec for lazy.nvim plugin manager&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank}.

Blender was fired up to edit the videos from the Isle of Wight and Red Barn rides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monday was the &lt;a href=&#34;#unexpected-life-as-a-cycle-courier&#34;&gt;20th anniversary of the tragedy of the London bombings&lt;/a&gt; on 7th July 2005. I remember it all too well as I was a cycle courier at at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed I finished all the maintenance on my Bianchi 928 RC road bike, which I have had since 2006. The Bianchi is still in excellent condition after a great many journeys and Audax events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have used a Garmin 1030 cycle computer for the last 7 years and its been really good experience. Unfortunately &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.garmin.com/en-GB/?faq=HX6aQKLbd14PO6JZfEgSv8&amp;amp;productID=567991&amp;amp;searchQuery=mount%20broken&amp;amp;tab=topics&#34;&gt;the mounting tabs have snapped&lt;/a&gt; and can no longer be mounted. I will try and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxXNjE1efYU&#34;&gt;repair the cycle computer by replacing the back case&lt;/a&gt; and if that fails I will consider trading in for a new Garmin. Either way, it seems time to consider &lt;a href=&#34;#choosing-a-new-cycle-computer&#34;&gt;choosing a new cycle computer for the next 5-10 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was hit by a large vehicle on the way back from &lt;a href=&#34;#collecting-the-new-cycle-computer&#34;&gt;collecting the new cycle computer&lt;/a&gt;.

The show has many rich characters and a few very silly ones (depending on your point of view). The storyline is based around a tragic crime that is being investigated by Agent Dale Cooper. Agent Cooper is not your typical FBI agent and really makes the show worth watching all by themselves ðŸ˜ƒ&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/half-way-through-the-year/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:46:33 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/half-way-through-the-year/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/june/30.png" type="image/png" length="49871" /> </item> <item> <title>Clojure LSP, Rust, Cycling &amp; Bike maintenance</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>cycling</category> <category>journal</category> <category>rust</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;#clojure-lsp&#34;&gt;Neovim section on the Clojure LSP site&lt;/a&gt; needed an update, so I created a PR with more information and updated configuration links.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#cycling&#34;&gt;Bicycle maintenance and a few final ride&lt;/a&gt; this week in preparation for the ride around the Isle of Wight. There were more replacements than I first thought, brake pads, cleats, pedals. I have done lots of long distance riding for most of the last 6 years (except the COVID years) so I shouldn&#39;t have been surprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been looking at more products from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aliexpress.com/&#34;&gt;AliExpress&lt;/a&gt; and revisited the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bdB2qt0Tp8&#34;&gt;Trace Velo video about Ali Express and if its worth it&lt;/a&gt; for tips on getting the most out of this website.

Lots of Yoga and a long ride at the weekend. Finding &lt;a href=&#34;#cycling&#34;&gt;some interesting routes for training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GitHub sent an email about &lt;a href=&#34;#github-org&#34;&gt;charging the Practicalli Org&lt;/a&gt;. Investigation revealed a change in that GitHub started to meter usage of user accounts and Organisations since March/April 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am starting to collect my thoughts about AI (and dig up information about software agents I researched back in 1997). An interesting aspect of AI is &lt;a href=&#34;#misconception-of-ai&#34;&gt;the relationship that people are building with AI&lt;/a&gt;, both positive and in some cases a little disturbing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Pleasuredome&#34;&gt;&#34;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&#34; by Frankie Goes To Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank}, specifically the anti-war song &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Tribes&#34;&gt;Two Tribes&lt;/a&gt;, reminded me of the early 1980&#39;s and the deep concern about nuclear war, which seems to be an increasing risk at the present time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The toppling of US-aligned governments in Iran and Nicaragua and the Soviet-Afghan war drove a significant increase of tension in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War&#34;&gt;cold war&lt;/a&gt;, as make prevalent in the UK by the government&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_and_Survive&#34;&gt;protect and survive&lt;/a&gt; public information campaign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remember watching the file &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads_(1984_film)&#34;&gt;Threads&lt;/a&gt;, an apocalyptic nuclear war drama which they actually showed us as school. The family in the film was very similar to my own when they were younger, so it did have a significant impact. After watching the film I realised how ineffectually the protect and survive information was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current near term risk to nuclear war being the violence over the continued land grab in the middle east, driven and masked by fear and hatred that has been there longer than everyone currently alive today. All this propped up with certain people using the politics of popularism to their own financial advantage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The longer term risk of nuclear war of course being countries fighting over ever dwindling resources, e.g. food and clean water &amp;amp; air, due to disastrous changes to the climate of planet Earth driven by unsustainable human activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 1980&#39;s had many songs that covered the darker part of humanity, often in a subtle way that people listening to the songs didn&#39;t realise (or want to realise). Here are a few examples I remembered:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_(song)&#34;&gt;Luka by Suzanne Vega&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} was quite a harrowing picture of child abuse and how&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Breath_You_Take&#34;&gt;Every breath you take by The Police&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} which is often though of as a love song and was in part about stalking and part authoritarian &#39;Big Brother&#39; control of the people&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_(song)&#34;&gt;Russians by Sting&lt;/a&gt; was a commentary on the dangers of the &#39;Mutually Assured Destruction&#39; doctrine pushed by the governments of the USA and Soviet Union. The song also inspired in part the nuclear war story of the Terminator movies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_to_Rule_the_World&#34;&gt;Everybody wants to run the world&lt;/a&gt; decries peoples desire for control and power, often at the expense of others. The song originally titled &#39;Everybody wants to go to war&#39; so reflecting aspects of the cold-war. The song also hints at humanities lack of respect for the environment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Air_Tonight&#34;&gt;In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins&lt;/a&gt; venting the frustration, anger and despair that so often accompanies divorce. A very poignant song personally as my parents had a very tumultuous divorce at that time that greatly affected me for many years.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/getting-hot/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2025 22:15:17 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/getting-hot/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/june/16.png" type="image/png" length="42205" /> </item> <item> <title>Passwords Fixes Maintenance and Tools</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>debian-linux</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interview for a new role last week and it seems a very interesting company.

An interesting thing I saw when signing up for an account was that 1Password first did a credit card check by trying to take 1 USD from my account. As the account was empty then my bank refused the withdrawal. So 1Password asked for $0 dollars instead, which my bank app prompted me to accept. I have 7 days trial to change my mind before they take the annual payment (32 Euros).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started the &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/rust&#34;&gt;Practicalli Rust book&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} although this is only the structure of the book and the CI publishing workflow for the moment. It does provide a central place to capture all my experiences with Rust and hopefully it will become useful to others in the near future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TV &amp;amp; Movies this week:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Evil Dead III - Army of Darkness: my favorite movie of the series, I&#39;ve watched this dozens of times and always enjoy.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paradise - an interesting show with good characters&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rich and Morty season 8 on Channel 4: first two episodes have been very enjoyable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/passwords-fixes-maintenance-and-tools/</link> <pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 23:21:32 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/passwords-fixes-maintenance-and-tools/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/june/09.png" type="image/png" length="58478" /> </item> <item> <title>Older and wiser</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;After last weeks experiments with Neovim 0.11 and AstroNvim version 5, it was time to put together the new &lt;a href=&#34;#neovim&#34;&gt;nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt;. The AstroNvim 5 based config is even simpler with fewer lines of code than current AstroNvim 4 config.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstroNvim has replaced many plugins with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim&#34;&gt;Snacks&lt;/a&gt; and it feels even more responsive to use and more visually appealing. I&#39;ve also updated the theme to Catppuccin (Cat Pussin&#39;) for Neovim and Kitty terminal app for a nice consistency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There will be some significant changes to add to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim book&lt;/a&gt; as the content migrates to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt;. So as to not disrupt users of &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Practicalli Astro&lt;/a&gt; (based on AstroNvim 4) I will use a separate git branch and publish initially to &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim-staging&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim Staging site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt; is feature compatible and has proven itself stable, I will push all the updates to &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I had to &lt;a href=&#34;Neovim Book Staging site&#34;&gt;create a staging website and workflow to publish from a seperate branch&lt;/a&gt; (or a pull request) for a book created with Material for MkDocs. A staging site was used for the Practicalli blog generated by Cryogen and pushed to a separate repository (GitHub Org token added for accessing a different repository).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TODO: Relesed Practicalli nvim-astro5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DOING: are there meaningful icon for linking to GitHub issues, pull requests and and projects? Other than the generic GitHub icon&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/&#34;&gt;Material for MkDocs Icons &amp;amp; Emoji page&lt;/a&gt; has a search across all icons and emojis available. Potential icons include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;:octicons-issue-opened-24: - Octicons issue open&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;:octicons-issue-closed-24: - Octicons issue closed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;:ticket: - a ticket&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;:tickets: - tickets (like ticket but red)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;:octicons-project-24: - a project board&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#arch-linux&#34;&gt;Updating to Neovim 0.11 on Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; was unexpectedly challenging and was an opportunity to look into package mirrors. It seems some mirrors are not updating as regularly as they could. Further investigation into the best mirrors to use for my geographical region seems valuable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contributions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity/pull/1435&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: PR #1435 disable nvim-treesitter-sexp for neovim 0.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PaterJason/nvim-treesitter-sexp/issues/12&#34;&gt;nvim-treesitter-sexp issue with neovim 0.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/older-and-wiser/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 18:32:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/older-and-wiser/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/april/07.png" type="image/png" length="44856" /> </item> <item> <title>Preparing Neovim Config release</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Preparing the first major release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Submitted 4 pull requests to Astrocommunity last week, to support the new config and keep it nice and light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Received a request to add Babashka file support to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some user acceptance testing work I did a few weeks ago, I received a nice sized Amazon gift card.

Especially when doing many small and disparate things, it is easy to forget what was done. The journal keeps my brain active and allows me a central place to review my activities (and feel good about them).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had the first interview in a year and a half and even though I &lt;a href=&#34;#interview-questions&#34;&gt;prepared for the interview questions using STAR responses&lt;/a&gt; I didnt feel I had sufficient focus in my responses during the interview and I dont think my health was good enough to be interviewing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am definitely out of practice interviewing, especially when very tight replies, so I will need to figure out how to effectively practice, or just do more &#39;practice&#39; interviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/learning-to-live-again/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 18:32:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/learning-to-live-again/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/february/17.png" type="image/png" length="47314" /> </item> <item> <title>Rescuing storage</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>nas</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Tweaks and maintenance updates to &lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli&#34;&gt;Practicalli projects&lt;/a&gt; and my Neovim config this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Continuing to organise my digital media which required recovery of a RAID array, using SSH to connect to the NAS and the &lt;code&gt;mdadm&lt;/code&gt; tool to &lt;a href=&#34;#nas-recovery&#34;&gt;repair the RAID array&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I forgot how crap Apple software can be when I tried to watch movies stored on my iPad via the Apple TV box connected to my TV. There is an AirPlay option in VLC and it picks up the AppleTV, however, it will only stream the audio and not the video. In the settings drop-down from the top-right (which has network, bluetooth, volume, etc.) has a screen mirror button that does actually stream both audio and video. They both seem to be using AirPlay, but selecting from VLC never seems to work, which is unfortunate as this is the most convenient button to select from within VLC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t feeling optimistic about &lt;a href=&#34;#my-health&#34;&gt;my health&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the week, but I managed a lot of walking, a 35km hilly cycle ride and a park run 5km in 38 mins. So my health is slowly getting a little better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do have greater pain in my throat and ears after the exercise, so am taking more paracetamol to help combat the inflammation there.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/rescuing-storage/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 18:32:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/rescuing-storage/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/february/24.png" type="image/png" length="46484" /> </item> <item> <title>Coming back to life</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>archlinux</category> <category>hyprland</category> <category>mkdocs</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday was a very productive day after vising the Doctors surgery to give yet another blood sample.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am enjoying using Hyprland on an old Lenovo Thinkpad X1 and using it to update my weekly &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/journal&#34;&gt;Practicalli Journal&lt;/a&gt; entries. I feel a long way off using Hyprland as my normal work laptop, but I do like the simplicity and eye candy that Hyprland and HyDE provides to the Linux desktop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyprland tweaks and notes continue throughout the month (year). This week I investigated how the &lt;a href=&#34;#hyprland&#34;&gt;padding around Kitty is configured in Hyprland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a spare laptop for the sofa means I can watch TV and relax while still capturing the highlights of the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently I am watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series&#34;&gt;Star Treck The Original Series&lt;/a&gt;. I am really enjoying Star Trek TOS, more than I expected. It has been several decades since I last saw some episodes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discussed options for running a &lt;a href=&#34;#clojure-workshop&#34;&gt;clojure workshop with minimal setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set up a Python local environment and installed Material for MkDocs on &lt;a href=&#34;#arch-linux&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a very sleepy weekend, my knee and hip are feeling almost normal again.

After taking it easy and catching up with various Star Wars series I started to have a lot more energy by the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#lazyvim&#34;&gt;LazyVim&lt;/a&gt; is another community configuration for Neovim, its quite nice out of the box and has a &#39;Clojure extras&#39; with Conjure support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking for an icon to represent a project maintainer, I browsed through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://octodex.github.com/&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: GitHub Octodex&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} that contains a wide variety of Octocat design images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backing up the last couple of projects on the Lenovo Extreme and will give ... a quick try before installing Debian Linux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#intellij-idea&#34;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA editor&lt;/a&gt; hasnt been on my radar for a long time until a friend reached out via Clojurians slack about the Clojure REPL and Clojure LSP plugins for Intellij. These open source plugins are a very interesting alternative to the commercial Cursive plugin. I took IntelliJ and these new plugins for a quick test run and liked the results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its &lt;a href=&#34;#self-assessment&#34;&gt;self-assessment&lt;/a&gt; time and hopefully I can get a little tax back from the UK government, expecially as I did a nice pension contribution and didnt work a full tax year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My local Co-op has been very short of supplies for the last few of weeks, something I havent seen since the UK left the European Union. Reading the result of the Co-op annual general meeting there was a link to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coop.co.uk/cyber-incident&#34;&gt;:globe_with_meridians: message from the CEO about a Cyber Incident&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank}.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems the Co-op systems were hacked and deliveries to Co-op stores were greatly affected, so there were very few products on the shelves. Deliveries have apparently resumed now, although I have enjoyed walking down to Waitrose instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did another order for organic hemp seeds, walnuts, peauts, jumbo oats and dried apricots from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forestwholefoods.co.uk/&#34;&gt;:globe_with_meridians: Forest Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank}.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/clojure-repl-intellij-plugin--lazyvim-config-for-neovim/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 18:32:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/clojure-repl-intellij-plugin--lazyvim-config-for-neovim/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/may/19.png" type="image/png" length="64248" /> </item> <item> <title>Organising Practicalli boards</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>markdown</category> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <category>squirrel-squadron</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;The week started with a Bank Holiday Monday and I was still sleepy after the 100km ride on Sunday. As I was too low on energy for Practialli work, I did lots of chores instead. I had more energy later in the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I received a puncture on the Sunday ride which was the first in about 5 years. It was relatively quick to change even though it was rear tire. I brought the punctured inner tube back home and repaired it with a patch along with some other &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;cycle maintenance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A search showed me how to correctly create &lt;a href=&#34;#markdown&#34;&gt;Markdown comments&lt;/a&gt; which are supported by todo comments. The todo comments help me track work that needs to be done within markdown files.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Started watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch&#34;&gt;Star Wars The Bad Bad&lt;/a&gt;{target=_blank} animated series from scratch as I hadn&#39;t seen it for a while and I hadn&#39;t seen season 3 at all yet. Season 3 is the final one for this show. I really like this show as it has some interesting characters and stories. The storyline starts where &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)&#34;&gt;Star Wars The Clone Wars&lt;/a&gt; animated series finishes, from the issue of Oder 66 that brings the Jedi order to an end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds died last week. The left earbud is now flashing red and white which means it cant connect the right eadbud (the main controller). I&#39;ve tried rebooting it several times but without success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bose support will offer me a small discount (189.99 instead of 219.99 on Amazon) on the Bose Quiet Elite earbuds if I send my faulty earbuds back. However this apparently takes about a month to confirm I&#39;ve sent the faulty earbuds back before Bose would send the new earbuds. Not a nice experience having to wait that long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do have some smaller Bose earbuds that work pretty well. I may shop around and probably try the Sony earbuds next time to see if they last longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/organising-practicalli-boards/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 18:32:16 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/organising-practicalli-boards/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/may/26.png" type="image/png" length="52740" /> </item> <item> <title>Learning Linux like its 1995</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;#arch-linux&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; (for Hyprland experiments) takes me back to the mid 1990&#39;s when I was learning Linux from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of 1994 I was installing Slackware Linux (from 82 floppy disks) and spending hours figuring out what to compile into the Linux kernel (before the days of dynamic loading). There was a huge amount to learn (usually without my own internet connection).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arch Linux wiki pages have a huge amount of information, showing all the possible options for every piece of software and service. This does present a dilemma of choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having experienced many years with Linux, I know many of the concepts and software associated with a Linux system. I don&#39;t need to read all the options, but do find myself scrolling a lot until I find something familiar (or simple).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have an &lt;a href=&#34;#hyprland&#34;&gt;Arch Linux desktop using Hyprland up and running&lt;/a&gt;, using HyDE to configure all the extra tools to make Hyprland useable as a desktop (although there are still some things to tweak and add).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hyprland configured with HyDE after fixing waybar configuration&#34; src=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/hyprland/hyprland-hyde-with-waybar.png?raw=true&#34;&gt;{loading=lazy}&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#neovim&#34;&gt;LSP file renaming with Neovim &amp;amp; LSP&lt;/a&gt; still fails using the Neovim LSP client, although it is fairly simple to rename a namespace and its corresponding file name using &lt;code&gt;clojure-lsp&lt;/code&gt; command line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Movies &amp;amp; Shows this week:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_on_the_Nile_(1978_film)&#34;&gt;Death on the Nile 1978&lt;/a&gt; with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, including an all-star cast from the time including David Niven, Angela Landsbury and Betty Davis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series&#34;&gt;Star Trek - The Original Series&lt;/a&gt; started watching this week as a way to switch off each evening, or more likely listen too whilst I write up the days journal.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/learning-linux-like-its-1995/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/learning-linux-like-its-1995/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2025/january/13.png" type="image/png" length="49647" /> </item> <item> <title>A new dawn a new day its a new life</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;As we come to the end of 2025 I continue to contemplate what is next?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do I want to continue in the software engineering industry with its many systemic faults?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or should I branch out and do something completely different?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://80000hours.org/&#34;&gt;80,000 hours&lt;/a&gt; is a guide to careers that have a positive impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My searching for a new home are currently focusing on the East coast of Scotland (which is dryer than London at the moment).

I am surprised GitHub have such a high default for their free plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upgraded to a &lt;a href=&#34;#new-monitor&#34;&gt;Dell 40 inch 5k2k monitor&lt;/a&gt; for work and it makes a huge difference. Its a beautiful monitor and it works really well with Linux and the tiling window of Regolith Desktop (i3).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am continuing my search for a new place to live, even further into the countryside with easy access to hiking and cycling activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I am always thankful for an opportunity to work with a commercial company, I do feel the weight lifted from my shoulders now that relationship has concluded.

QUOTE You are only a leader if people are willing to follow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has been hard to shake the concern that my current commercial role has not worked out, probably not really been working for quite a while in hindsight. Was it ever really working?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some aspects have greatly improved but there are some fundamental communication constraints that I really didn&#39;t understand the cause of (plenty of assumptions, but not enough communication or time to really address these challenges).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are the common systemic challenges that come from working at any startup that is working hard to establish itself as a long term sustainable business. This was a given. A new person coming into this environment that has been running for many years leaves a lot of context unknown and typically unspoken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I continued to try identify the causes throughout the week and trying to evaluate if there is any appetite and opportunity to address these within our typical schedule. It did feel that the more I tried to connect the quicker the feeling of connection slipped away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe my frustration and disappointment have been leaking out over the last month, which I am disappointed about as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is always a challenge for an engineering manager to identify where they can add value. For much of the current role I never seemed to connect with the team at a deep enough level. It is too easy to feel I am simply not needed by the team as the communication has been very limited. In once exceptional case, it was easy to feel my presence was simply not wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tuesday I was really exhausted, partly because of the continued cough but also the concerns that I still wasn&#39;t able to break through to the team (especially if they feel unsafe to ask questions). I am not sleeping well and need to find energy to exercise more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wednesday I made time for self-reflection as part of the company feedback initiative. I did struggle to quantify to myself what I had done. In hindsight I should have spend more time on this and consulted my journal, although I still feel I would come up short of my own lofty goals for the role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friday was the end of my commercial current role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title of this article is from the first episode of the first series of the Black Adder TV show.

QUOTE &#34;Johnny Stevenson (maybe others)&#34; People are wonderfully complex experiences&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My feelings of disappointed with my current commercial role are returning to the forefront of my mind. Many aspects of the role and company seem to be clear in peoples minds but not always effectively shared. I think I understand the role and then something else happens that makes me feel I don&#39;t. I believe something will need to change soon for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been a few highlights with the role, but I expected more of myself and the company. I do set high expectations for myself, although have learned to be more kind about what I can realistically achieve and &#39;which battles to fight&#39; (figuratively speaking of course).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During this engagement I have continually reset my expectations about what could be achieved and what I could realistically achieve. There are a couple of peers where there has been conflict without understanding of why I am seen as the cause. I have tried to explore but if people do have issues with me its not clearly being communicated to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In hindsight, many opportunities to get support from my manger and peers were missed. Mostly as we had so many challenges to discuss and partly due to pressures of delivery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a person doesn&#39;t have clarity around a problem then there is very little they can do to resolve or adapt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A self-reflection review is in progress and its is a good opportunity to take my own time to reflect on my current role and if its still the right fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/the-wonderful-complexity-of-people/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/the-wonderful-complexity-of-people/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2024/november/04.png" type="image/png" length="56794" /> </item> <item> <title>Back to work</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Busy week at work getting ready for a new team member.

It feels a lot more organised and easier to find everything as everything has its place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I can focus on getting lots of &lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli&#34;&gt;Practicalli content done&lt;/a&gt; (as well as catch up with shows on Paramount+ and maybe a little Polybus on the Playstation4 VR headset)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am interested in switching to the Hyprland, although its changing fast so I dug out an older laptop and installed Arch Linux with Hyprland using the &lt;code&gt;archinstall&lt;/code&gt; tool. Unfortunately the laptop I used doesnt seem to support Hyprland or something is missing from the install.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am taking a stay-cation as I am still recovering from Covid and the weather is also quite grim. I am getting out for walks each day and on Friday I completed a short cycle ride as it was nice and sunny outside. Unfortunately my chest started feeling like it was on fire a few minutes into the ride, so I slowed down and limited myself to 10km.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was feeling really sleepy after the ride, so I kept myself awake by sorting through the cardboard boxes in my attic. Many boxes made the ultimate sacrifice (for an uncluttered house) and went to the recycling service.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <link>https://practical.li/journal/hacking-on-practicalli-content/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate> <source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_created.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/hacking-on-practicalli-content/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/posts/2024/october/14.png" type="image/png" length="50622" /> </item> </channel> </rss>
