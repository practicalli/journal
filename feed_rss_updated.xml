There is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline&#34;&gt;:globe_with_meridians: Catppuccin Powerline Preset&lt;/a&gt; (theme) that &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/dotfiles/blob/main/starship.toml&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: was customised&lt;/a&gt; to move some information onto the right-hand side of the prompt and tweaked some of the default Catppuccin Mocha colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Practicalli Customisation of catppuccin-powerline preset&#34; src=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/command-line/starship-cli-preset-catppuccin-custom.png?raw=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MkDocs is used for all Practicalli websites and something has changed so that &lt;a href=&#34;#mkdocs-issues&#34;&gt;:anchor: running a local website fails to build&lt;/a&gt;. This does make using MkDocs a little more fiddly to use. If I dont use embedded files in a code block then everything seems okay again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week I have been volunteering at &lt;a href=&#34;#devoxx-uk&#34;&gt;:anchor: Devoxx UK in London&lt;/a&gt;. Tuesday was setting up activates for the event, such as building video game cabinets. Wednesday and Thursday was room monitor, ensuring the speakers and attendees are taken care of. The room monitor also captures feedback about the event back to the conference organisers (so they can continue optimising the conference for next year).&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/volunteering-at-devoxx/</link> <pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2025 18:57:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/volunteering-at-devoxx/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/volunteering-at-devoxx.png" type="image/png" length="None" /> </item> <item> <title>Older and wiser</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;After last weeks experiments with Neovim 0.11 and AstroNvim version 5, it was time to put together the new &lt;a href=&#34;#neovim&#34;&gt;nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt;. The AstroNvim 5 based config is even simpler with fewer lines of code than current AstroNvim 4 config.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AstroNvim has replaced many plugins with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim&#34;&gt;Snacks&lt;/a&gt; and it feels even more responsive to use and more visually appealing. I&#39;ve also updated the theme to Catppuccin (Cat Pussin&#39;) for Neovim and Kitty terminal app for a nice consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be some significant changes to add to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim book&lt;/a&gt; as the content migrates to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt;. So as to not disrupt users of &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Practicalli Astro&lt;/a&gt; (based on AstroNvim 4) I will use a separate git branch and publish initially to &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim-staging&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim Staging site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/nvim-astro5&#34;&gt;Practicalli nvim-astro5 configuration&lt;/a&gt; is feature compatible and has proven itself stable, I will push all the updates to &lt;a href=&#34;https://practical.li/neovim&#34;&gt;Practicalli Neovim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I had to &lt;a href=&#34;Neovim Book Staging site&#34;&gt;create a staging website and workflow to publish from a seperate branch&lt;/a&gt; (or a pull request) for a book created with Material for MkDocs. A staging site was used for the Practicalli blog generated by Cryogen and pushed to a separate repository (GitHub Org token added for accessing a different repository).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TODO: Relesed Practicalli nvim-astro5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOING: are there meaningful icon for linking to GitHub issues, pull requests and and projects? Other than the generic GitHub icon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/&#34;&gt;Material for MkDocs Icons &amp;amp; Emoji page&lt;/a&gt; has a search across all icons and emojis available. Potential icons include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;:octicons-issue-opened-24: - Octicons issue open&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;:octicons-issue-closed-24: - Octicons issue closed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;:ticket: - a ticket&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;:tickets: - tickets (like ticket but red)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;:octicons-project-24: - a project board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#arch-linux&#34;&gt;Updating to Neovim 0.11 on Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; was unexpectedly challenging and was an opportunity to look into package mirrors. It seems some mirrors are not updating as regularly as they could. Further investigation into the best mirrors to use for my geographical region seems valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity/pull/1435&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: PR #1435 disable nvim-treesitter-sexp for neovim 0.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/PaterJason/nvim-treesitter-sexp/issues/12&#34;&gt;nvim-treesitter-sexp issue with neovim 0.11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/older-and-wiser/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:06:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/older-and-wiser/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/older-and-wiser.png" type="image/png" length="44862" /> </item> <item> <title>Day 88 - Clojure driven finance startup and 4Clojure</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>100daysofcode</category> <category>clojure</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;#4clojure-challenges&#34;&gt;4Clojure challenge&lt;/a&gt;, this time #9 covering sets in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lunch with a another company with Clojure roles, cycling to and from the meeting on the Bromptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weirdest Interview&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is called Be-Social, a finance startup that is building an app to make spending money a more social activity and enabling friends and colleagues to share bills and other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview with the Founder and CTO when very well and the role was very clear to me. Unfortunately the follow-on interview with two developers when very poorly as they seemed to be interviewing me for a very different role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers didn&#39;t seem at all prepared and were &#39;trying something different&#39; apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started with what they called a &#39;pairing session&#39; where they handed my a laptop (it was a Mac and I had not used one in a long time). I struggled to use the mouse to click and the developers couldn&#39;t (be bothered to) explain how they had set it up. I muddled on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &#39;pairing&#39; continued where I struggled to use the Mac and IntelliJ (something else I hadn&#39;t used) to try understand a code base using libraries I had never used. I asked questions about the code but the developers refused to answer them, saying I should just experiment with the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I couldn&#39;t figure out how the Clojure REPL worked in IntelliJ and they didn&#39;t know either, my ability to experiment was severely limited. It wasn&#39;t even clear how to start the application so I could see it running or run any unit tests. The developers just stat there and watched the screen or stared at me, without answering any questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this time I was becoming quite disillusioned with the developers in front of me. I was trying not to focus on the question of why I wanted to work with people so closed as this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that neither of the developers interviewing me were playing their part in the &#39;pairing&#39; process and watched me struggle instead. Actually one of the developers was feeling so out of their depth that they didn&#39;t really engage in any part of the interview, except to say that they were feeling out of their depth when I did ask about their role during our brief introductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 30 minutes of not &#39;pairing&#39; with me, they proceeded to quiz me on obscure information about REST. One of the developers took great pride in how much they had learned about REST, the four levels of REST and lots of other niche information. This seemed to be the measure of how good an engineer would be, mainly because that is how his previous (and only) tech lead had worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked out of the interview at the end with the final words that they should talk to their founder about what they are looking for, to save everyone some time. I had no illusions that any kind of follow-up from the interview would be forth-coming. I was pleased not to have to even consider a role there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its not the first time (probably no the last) that people within a company have wildly different expectations. Its like they haven&#39;t actually talked to each other about the role :shocked_face_with_exploding_head:&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/day-88---clojure-driven-finance-startup-and-4clojure/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 13:06:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/day-88---clojure-driven-finance-startup-and-4clojure/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/day-88---clojure-driven-finance-startup-and-4clojure.png" type="image/png" length="None" /> </item> <item> <title>Hacking Material theme for MkDocs</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>archlinux</category> <category>mkdocs</category> <category>neogit</category> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying out an aesthetic change to the Practicalli websites by &lt;a href=&#34;#material-for-mkdocs&#34;&gt;changing buttons to have rounded corners&lt;/a&gt;.

There is an AirPlay option in VLC and it picks up the AppleTV, however, it will only stream the audio and not the video. In the settings drop-down from the top-right (which has network, bluetooth, volume, etc.) has a screen mirror button that does actually stream both audio and video. They both seem to be using AirPlay, but selecting from VLC never seems to work, which is unfortunate as this is the most convenient button to select from within VLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t feeling optimistic about &lt;a href=&#34;#my-health&#34;&gt;my health&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the week, but I managed a lot of walking, a 35km hilly cycle ride and a park run 5km in 38 mins.

There was a huge amount to learn (usually without my own internet connection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux wiki pages have a huge amount of information, showing all the possible options for every piece of software and service. This does present a dilemma of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having experienced many years with Linux, I know many of the concepts and software associated with a Linux system. I don&#39;t need to read all the options, but do find myself scrolling a lot until I find something familiar (or simple).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an &lt;a href=&#34;#hyprland&#34;&gt;Arch Linux desktop using Hyprland up and running&lt;/a&gt;, using HyDE to configure all the extra tools to make Hyprland useable as a desktop (although there are still some things to tweak and add).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Hyprland configured with HyDE after fixing waybar configuration&#34; src=&#34;https://github.com/practicalli/graphic-design/blob/live/os/hyprland/hyprland-hyde-with-waybar.png?raw=true&#34;&gt;{loading=lazy}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#neovim&#34;&gt;LSP file renaming with Neovim &amp;amp; LSP&lt;/a&gt; still fails using the Neovim LSP client, although it is fairly simple to rename a namespace and its corresponding file name using &lt;code&gt;clojure-lsp&lt;/code&gt; command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies &amp;amp; Shows this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_on_the_Nile_(1978_film)&#34;&gt;Death on the Nile 1978&lt;/a&gt; with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, including an all-star cast from the time including David Niven, Angela Landsbury and Betty Davis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series&#34;&gt;Star Trek - The Original Series&lt;/a&gt; started watching this week as a way to switch off each evening, or more likely listen too whilst I write up the days journal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/learning-linux-like-its-1995/</link> <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 00:50:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/learning-linux-like-its-1995/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/learning-linux-like-its-1995.png" type="image/png" length="49651" /> </item> <item> <title>A freezing start to a new year</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>archlinux</category> <category>audacity</category> <category>opus</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;GitHub is currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10636&#34;&gt;:fontawesome-brands-github: rolling out a change to make Ubuntu 24.04 the default image&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=&#34;#github-ci-workflow&#34;&gt;running a workflow on &lt;code&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I can no longer login to the desktop :facepalm: EDIT: this seems to be specific to the NWG-shell configuration, as the vanilla hyprland desktop does work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume this is a breaking change of hyprland that NWG-shell has not resolved. This is another reason to start again with hyprland and build my own config (although this will be a big time sink, so can wait).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its freezing temperatures outside in London, UK at the moment, so I am trying to get outside when the sun is still shining.

I have not had much success with Regolith when running with Wayland (specifically Sway).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sway compositor is an implementation of wayland for i3 window manager. Some of my applications do not see to play nice with Sway (e.g. chromium browser scrolling, simplescreenrecorder cannot run on wayland).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OBS did seem to work okay on wayland, given a sufficiently recent version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend recommended Hyprland, a tiling compositor that provides the latest Wayland features and lots of eye candy. Its pretty easy to setup on Debian, although there is much additional setup before it would be comparable to Regolith Desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neovim Grug plugin is being considered as an alternative to the Spectre tool for search and replacing across a project.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/linux-wayland-compositor--hyprland/</link> <pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2024 22:52:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/linux-wayland-compositor--hyprland/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/linux-wayland-compositor--hyprland.png" type="image/png" length="59801" /> </item> <item> <title>Practicalli plans for the rest of the year</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>github</category> <category>hardware</category> <category>practicalli</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting to &lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli-plans&#34;&gt;plan work for the Practicalli content&lt;/a&gt; for the next 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Practicalli GitHub Org, &lt;a href=&#34;#optimise-github-org-log-retention&#34;&gt;action log retention time was minimised&lt;/a&gt; to a week (from 90 days) as I don&#39;t need to wade through that history and it will save a bit of storage in the Cloud. I am surprised GitHub have such a high default for their free plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upgraded to a &lt;a href=&#34;#new-monitor&#34;&gt;Dell 40 inch 5k2k monitor&lt;/a&gt; for work and it makes a huge difference.

QUOTE &#34;Johnny Stevenson (maybe others)&#34; People are wonderfully complex experiences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My feelings of disappointed with my current commercial role are returning to the forefront of my mind. Many aspects of the role and company seem to be clear in peoples minds but not always effectively shared. I think I understand the role and then something else happens that makes me feel I don&#39;t. I believe something will need to change soon for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been a few highlights with the role, but I expected more of myself and the company. I do set high expectations for myself, although have learned to be more kind about what I can realistically achieve and &#39;which battles to fight&#39; (figuratively speaking of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this engagement I have continually reset my expectations about what could be achieved and what I could realistically achieve. There are a couple of peers where there has been conflict without understanding of why I am seen as the cause. I have tried to explore but if people do have issues with me its not clearly being communicated to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, many opportunities to get support from my manger and peers were missed. Mostly as we had so many challenges to discuss and partly due to pressures of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person doesn&#39;t have clarity around a problem then there is very little they can do to resolve or adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A self-reflection review is in progress and its is a good opportunity to take my own time to reflect on my current role and if its still the right fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/the-wonderful-complexity-of-people/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2024 17:03:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/the-wonderful-complexity-of-people/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/the-wonderful-complexity-of-people.png" type="image/png" length="56811" /> </item> <item> <title>The king is probably dead long live the king</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>leadership</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;!!! QUOTE You are only a leader if people are willing to follow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been hard to shake the concern that my current commercial role has not worked out, probably not really been working for quite a while in hindsight. Was it ever really working?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some aspects have greatly improved but there are some fundamental communication constraints that I really didn&#39;t understand the cause of (plenty of assumptions, but not enough communication or time to really address these challenges).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are the common systemic challenges that come from working at any startup that is working hard to establish itself as a long term sustainable business. This was a given. A new person coming into this environment that has been running for many years leaves a lot of context unknown and typically unspoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continued to try identify the causes throughout the week and trying to evaluate if there is any appetite and opportunity to address these within our typical schedule. It did feel that the more I tried to connect the quicker the feeling of connection slipped away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe my frustration and disappointment have been leaking out over the last month, which I am disappointed about as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is always a challenge for an engineering manager to identify where they can add value. For much of the current role I never seemed to connect with the team at a deep enough level. It is too easy to feel I am simply not needed by the team as the communication has been very limited. In once exceptional case, it was easy to feel my presence was simply not wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday I was really exhausted, partly because of the continued cough but also the concerns that I still wasn&#39;t able to break through to the team (especially if they feel unsafe to ask questions). I am not sleeping well and need to find energy to exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I made time for self-reflection as part of the company feedback initiative. I did struggle to quantify to myself what I had done. In hindsight I should have spend more time on this and consulted my journal, although I still feel I would come up short of my own lofty goals for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday was the end of my commercial current role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of this article is from the first episode of the first series of the Black Adder TV show.

I typically use an external keyboard (e.g. Keyboard.io Atreus or Model100), especially when considerable typing is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the hardware and compilation tooling is different for Android Linux (compared to amd64 linux) the Clojure and Lua LSP language servers would not install via the Mason manager. As these two languages are in the top 3 languages I use, then it is a great boost to get these servers working locally and configuring Neovim to use them instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; command when I had a need to tweak the time on my Linux computer, saves launching the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; app and using the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!!! INFO &#34;Timezones made easy&#34; &lt;a href=&#34;https://time.is/&#34;&gt;time.is&lt;/a&gt; makes figuring out timezones really simple. See the current time in any timezone across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;time.is very useful for events where people attend from different timezones. Set the local time and share a link for others who will see the event time in their own timezone.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Neovim&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m making some changes to the Practicalli AstroNvim configuration (AstroNvim4) over the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All my personal Neovim &amp;amp; plugin options (and associated workflow biases) will only be in &lt;code&gt;lua/plugins/practicalli.lua&lt;/code&gt;. With these options only in one file, anyone else using the configuration can easily disable them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will encourage other users to create there own &lt;code&gt;lua/plugins/personal.lua&lt;/code&gt; customisation so any changes from upstream will be easier to merge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repository will be renamed to &lt;code&gt;practicalli/astro-config&lt;/code&gt; which its much easier to write and say during screencasts. GitHub should redirect when pulling updates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week I will update Practicalli Neovim book install guide with new repo and further info on how to use the config effectively (especially with your own customisations)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the first official release of the config will be created via GitHub releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I have time, there are lots of things to add to Practicalli Neovim book too (including a few more plugins I&#39;m using in the config)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/neovim-on-termux-enhancements/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:22:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/neovim-on-termux-enhancements/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/neovim-on-termux-enhancements.png" type="image/png" length="51705" /> </item> <item> <title>Springing back into life slowly</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;The last month has been tough due to illness, although still managed to do a little work with Practicalli to keep me motivated (both for work and my own personal health)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I though the Practicalli Project Templates had broken when I tried to create a new service project.

The parts of Neogit that use 0.10 api should be more efficient, although I assume there wont be a noticable difference in functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will update Neovim to 0.10 when AstroNvim confirms it is working well with that release.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/git-multiple-ssh-keys--neovim/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:22:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/git-multiple-ssh-keys--neovim/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/git-multiple-ssh-keys--neovim.png" type="image/png" length="56424" /> </item> <item> <title>Company offsite week</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>astronvim</category> <category>neovim</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Travelled for a work event in Portugal with a chance to meet people I work with face to face for the first time.

It feels a lot more organised and easier to find everything as everything has its place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I can focus on getting lots of &lt;a href=&#34;#practicalli&#34;&gt;Practicalli content done&lt;/a&gt; (as well as catch up with shows on Paramount+ and maybe a little Polybus on the Playstation4 VR headset)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am interested in switching to the Hyprland, although its changing fast so I dug out an older laptop and installed Arch Linux with Hyprland using the &lt;code&gt;archinstall&lt;/code&gt; tool. Unfortunately the laptop I used doesnt seem to support Hyprland or something is missing from the install.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am taking a stay-cation as I am still recovering from Covid and the weather is also quite grim. I am getting out for walks each day and on Friday I completed a short cycle ride as it was nice and sunny outside. Unfortunately my chest started feeling like it was on fire a few minutes into the ride, so I slowed down and limited myself to 10km.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was feeling really sleepy after the ride, so I kept myself awake by sorting through the cardboard boxes in my attic. Many boxes made the ultimate sacrifice (for an uncluttered house) and went to the recycling service.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://practical.li/journal/hacking-on-practicalli-content/</link> <pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2024 15:22:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://practical.li/journal/feed_rss_updated.xml">Practicalli Personal Journal</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://practical.li/journal/hacking-on-practicalli-content/</guid> <enclosure url="https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/hacking-on-practicalli-content.png" type="image/png" length="50622" /> </item> <item> <title>Megalinter 8 and monthly version updates</title> <author>Practicalli Johnny</author> <category>clojure</category> <category>practicalli</category> <description>&lt;p&gt;Megalinter updates to version 8 using the megalinter runner tool, adding a Makefile task to simplify the command line (so I dont have to remember the command).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material for MkDocs provides a nice diff view using the &lt;code&gt;diff&lt;/code&gt; language for a code block.
