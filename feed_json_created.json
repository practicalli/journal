The family in the film was very similar to my own when they were younger, so it did have a significant impact.  After watching the film I realised how ineffectually the protect and survive information was.</p>\n<p>The current near term risk to nuclear war being the violence over the continued land grab in the middle east, driven and masked by fear and hatred that has been there longer than everyone currently alive today.  All this propped up with certain people using the politics of popularism to their own financial advantage.</p>\n<p>The longer term risk of nuclear war of course being countries fighting over ever dwindling resources, e.g. food and clean water &amp; air, due to disastrous changes to the climate of planet Earth driven by unsustainable human activities.</p>\n<p>The 1980's had many songs that covered the darker part of humanity, often in a subtle way that people listening to the songs didn't realise (or want to realise).

The song also inspired in part the nuclear war story of the Terminator movies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_to_Rule_the_World\">Everybody wants to run the world</a> decries peoples desire for control and power, often at the expense of others.  The song originally titled 'Everybody wants to go to war' so reflecting aspects of the cold-war.  The song also hints at humanities lack of respect for the environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Air_Tonight\">In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins</a> venting the frustration, anger and despair that so often accompanies divorce.

The storyline starts where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)\">Star Wars The Clone Wars</a> animated series finishes, from the issue of Oder 66 that brings the Jedi order to an end.</p>\n<p>My Bose Quiet Comfort earbuds died last week.  The left earbud is now flashing red and white which means it cant connect the right eadbud (the main controller).  I've tried rebooting it several times but without success.</p>\n<p>Bose support will offer me a small discount (189.99 instead of 219.99 on Amazon) on the Bose Quiet Elite earbuds if I send my faulty earbuds back.  However this apparently takes about a month to confirm I've sent the faulty earbuds back before Bose would send the new earbuds.  Not a nice experience having to wait that long.</p>\n<p>I do have some smaller Bose earbuds that work pretty well.
