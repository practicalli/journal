I have some exercises to help with 'tennis elbow' and 'trigger finger' in my left arm and hand.

I do not follow a religion although I do appreciate the sun rising every day.  I have cats to keep me company and I also look after my neighbours cat for a few days.</p>\n<p>Winter is when I do less cycling outside, especially when there is a risk of ice.  Instead I work on my core muscles with yoga and occasional brave the outside for a Park Run.  I have had an injury on my foot which has taken a few months to heal (as I have been very active), so Park Run events for me will be a brisk part walk (maybe running for the last 50 meters).</p>\n<p>Started to consider what this year has meant for me by looking at other peoples 2025 round-ups.  The most enjoyable roundup so far is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qdI2e8fmx40?si=-Ln3I1uJ41S4lN72\">Kermod &amp; Mayo's Best and Worst Films of the Year</a>, which also included best TV shows (that Mark Kermod has watched) of the year.</p>\n<p>I have a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device at home as a convenient central backup for work and media files.  The NAS was configured with a RAID6 array, but unfortunately two disks in the RAID 6 array had failed. I discovered that changing 2 disks on the RAID array was not necessarily a safe option, especially if yet another disk became faulty during the rebuild (which can take many hours).</p>\n<p>I am attempting again to recover the RAID array.  If that fails, I will rebuild the NAS with 2 separate RAID6 arrays, increasing further the resilience of the storage in case of hardware issues.</p>\n<p>Eventually I will replace the 'disk' drives with solid state storage devices (SSD), especially as a 4TB SSD can be found for around 160 GBP.  Using SSD rather than spinning 'disks' also makes the NAS device really quite.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: I have other backup mechanisms as RAID should not be used as a permanent backup solution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Entertainment this week included</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blakes 7 season 3 (usually watched as I fall asleep)</li>\n<li>Slow Horses season 5 - excellent show that keeps my gripped (watched the first 4 episodes in one night)</li>\n<li>Pol1bus - wonderfully funny and quirky show (I am not sure if I am rooting for the right protagonists)</li>\n<li>Foundation season 1 &amp; 2 - watched again in preparation for season 3 this week</li>\n<li>Dr Who - watching Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth doctor and really enjoying the depth of stories that are portrait</li>\n</ul>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/pagan-festival-parties.png", "date_modified": "2025-12-26T18:26:53+00:00", "date_published": "2025-12-26T18:26:53+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["nas", "practicalli"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/continuing-to-downsize/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/continuing-to-downsize/", "title": "Continuing to downsize", "content_html": "<p>As its coming up to the festive season, I though it would be a great time to <a href=\"#donating-tech\">donate unwanted electronics and computing items</a>.</p>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/continuing-to-downsize.png", "date_modified": "2025-12-22T20:58:37+00:00", "date_published": "2025-12-22T20:58:37+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["practicalli", "recycle"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/winding-down-for-2025/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/winding-down-for-2025/", "title": "Winding down for 2025", "content_html": "<p>I have completed my 6,000 km distance goal for cycling, so I will focus on other activities such as walking and yoga.

I felt confident I knew how to write a clear question (prompt) for the LLM tool.  It was also a small enough task that I wouldnt blow all my 'free' tokens.  I also hoped that it was a simple enough task that I wouldnt have to keep refining the question to get the response I needed.</p>\n<p>The reply should be simple enough that I can understand, as I already have plenty of experience writing GitHub workflows and configurations for the tools used by a workflow (e.g. Megalinter).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the resulting Renovate.json configuration doesnt like Clojure, so AI seems to have failed quite badly (or was too optimistic).</p>\n<p>Taking my usual approach of an Internet search, I discovered the Mend App, which is described in more detail in the <a href=\"https://docs.mend.io/integrations/latest/mend-for-github-com\">Mend for GitHub.com docs</a>.</p>\n<p>The Mend app kind of works but still seems to require some manual intervention (pressing buttons on developer.mend.io app) and only supports (or only configured for) maven dependencies and not git updates, e.g. seancorfield/deps-new.</p>\n<p>The results of the discussion with the LLM are documented in this post and the results were also published to the web:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/98bc2a13-f609-4bb3-b31e-b5fd47556d85\">Create GitHub workflow with Renovate for Clojure projects</a>{target=_blank .md-button}</p>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/something-a-foot.png", "date_modified": "2025-12-08T19:45:47+00:00", "date_published": "2025-12-08T19:45:47+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["ai-tool-llm", "clojure", "practicalli"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/hello-darkness-my-old-friend/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/hello-darkness-my-old-friend/", "title": "Hello darkness my old friend", "content_html": "<p>It is getting noticeably darker now, before I finish 'working' on Practicalli content and other computer things.</p>\n<p>At the end of last week I <a href=\"#clojure-community\">contributed questions to the next Clojure Survey</a>, which I assume will be out in early January 2026.

I posted them on Freegle at the weekend and after one person didnt turn up, another came on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Thursday the boiler was serviced and I also arranged a service for my neighbour (who looks after my cats).  One of the people I cycle with is a plumber, so its nice to have someone I can trust looking at the boiler.  My boiler is in very good condition, which is nice.</p>\n<p>Saturday I was helping my neighbour identify the cause of a vibration with their central heating system.

An interesting aspect of AI is <a href=\"#misconception-of-ai\">the relationship that people are building with AI</a>, both positive and in some cases a little disturbing.</p>\n<p>Listening to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Pleasuredome\">\"Welcome to the Pleasuredome\" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood</a>{target=_blank}, specifically the anti-war song <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Tribes\">Two Tribes</a>, reminded me of the early 1980's and the deep concern about nuclear war, which seems to be an increasing risk at the present time.</p>\n<p>The toppling of US-aligned governments in Iran and Nicaragua and the Soviet-Afghan war drove a significant increase of tension in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War\">cold war</a>, as make prevalent in the UK by the government's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protect_and_Survive\">protect and survive</a> public information campaign.</p>\n<p>I remember watching the file <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads_(1984_film)\">Threads</a>, an apocalyptic nuclear war drama which they actually showed us as school.  The family in the film was very similar to my own when they were younger, so it did have a significant impact.  After watching the film I realised how ineffectually the protect and survive information was.</p>\n<p>The current near term risk to nuclear war being the violence over the continued land grab in the middle east, driven and masked by fear and hatred that has been there longer than everyone currently alive today.  All this propped up with certain people using the politics of popularism to their own financial advantage.</p>\n<p>The longer term risk of nuclear war of course being countries fighting over ever dwindling resources, e.g. food and clean water &amp; air, due to disastrous changes to the climate of planet Earth driven by unsustainable human activities.</p>\n<p>The 1980's had many songs that covered the darker part of humanity, often in a subtle way that people listening to the songs didn't realise (or want to realise).  Here are a few examples I remembered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_(song)\">Luka by Suzanne Vega</a>{target=_blank} was quite a harrowing picture of child abuse and how</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Breath_You_Take\">Every breath you take by The Police</a>{target=_blank} which is often though of as a love song and was in part about stalking and part authoritarian 'Big Brother' control of the people</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_(song)\">Russians by Sting</a> was a commentary on the dangers of the 'Mutually Assured Destruction' doctrine pushed by the governments of the USA and Soviet Union. The song also inspired in part the nuclear war story of the Terminator movies.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_to_Rule_the_World\">Everybody wants to run the world</a> decries peoples desire for control and power, often at the expense of others.  The song originally titled 'Everybody wants to go to war' so reflecting aspects of the cold-war.  The song also hints at humanities lack of respect for the environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Air_Tonight\">In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins</a> venting the frustration, anger and despair that so often accompanies divorce.  A very poignant song personally as my parents had a very tumultuous divorce at that time that greatly affected me for many years.</li>\n</ul>", "image": "https://practical.li/journal/assets/images/social/getting-hot.png", "date_modified": "2025-06-23T01:37:51+00:00", "date_published": "2025-06-19T22:15:17+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Practicalli Johnny"}], "tags": ["artificial-intelligence", "cycling", "github", "music", "practicalli"]}, {"id": "https://practical.li/journal/passwords-fixes-maintenance-and-tools/", "url": "https://practical.li/journal/passwords-fixes-maintenance-and-tools/", "title": "Passwords Fixes Maintenance and Tools", "content_html": "<p>I had an interview for a new role last week and it seems a very interesting company.
