There was a limited understanding of job opportunities using Haskel, certainly compared to Java and Scala.</p> <p>I volunteered to start running a practical community event to practice Scala together.  I attended the Python and Clojure dojo events to see how to run an event for Scala.</p> <p>After finding a company willing to host (and more importantly provide pizza and drinks) I started running a monthly Scala dojo.</p> <p>I kept going to the Clojure dojo as it was a very welcoming group and I was also facinated and highly confused by the language itself.</p> <p>During the first year of Clojure dojo events I slowly became very attached to the simplicity of solutions that could be created with language (even though I did strugle to understand the language as I wasnt dedicating enough time to learn it).</p> <p>I was also attracted by the thought of using Emacs for development, an editor that felt less complicated and heavyweight compared to IntelliJ used by most people for Java and Scala.</p> <p>Startup &amp; compilation speed challenges</p> <p>IntelliJ has a very powerful indexing capability, however, for Scala it was indexing Java and Scala standard libraries which did add a few minutes when starting a projects.</p> <p>The Scala compiler in its early days did take some time to complete.  As all the code was required to compile before running, then the feedback time during development was a bit of a constraint.</p> <p>Tooling optomisations and faster laptops did make things better during the first year, although still in a different time frame compared to the instant feedback with Clojure.</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#conference-talks","title":"Conference talks","text":"<p>To focus my efforts to learn Clojure and share my enthusiasm, I started submitting talk proposals for conferences.  An additional benefit was to go to the conferences for free.</p> <p>JAX London accepted my first Clojure talk proposal.  I was very nervous giving the first talk and was still struggling to explain some of the concepts.  However, the audience was very supportive in general.</p> <p>One person sat right at the front of the audience started to heckle me half way through.  They wanted 'real world' examples of Clojure even though the talk was advertised as a simple introduction.  Out of frustration I replied, \"this isnt the real world, its JAX London\".  The audience laught out quite loudly, exept for the heckler who I think became more annoyed.</p> <p>I learned a lot about what I didnt understand about Clojure and undeterred I worked on creating better talks.</p> <p>I was hired by Atlassian as an Enginner and product ambassador (developer relations) which gave me a chance to present talks at conferences all over Europe.</p> <p>The talk I enjoyed the most was at JavaDays in Sofia, Bulgaria.  I had moved away from slides and simply walked through live code examples, evaluating the code so the audience could see the REPL workflow as well as seeing the code in action.</p> <p>Working at Salesforce I was also encouraged to submit talks to conferences (as well as present with other community members at Salesforce specific events).  I would submit talks and workshops on Salesforce and Clojure topics to double the chance of being accepted.  Almost all conferences accepted Clojure talks over the Salesforce talks, although CodeMotion Rome did accept a Salesforce workshop as well as a Clojure talk.</p> <p>The most sureal environment I gave a Clojure talk at was CeBit, a huge conference in Hanover, Germany.  The conference is so huge it is spread over 18 aircraft hanger sized buildings and there are busses to shuttle people around the conference as it takes at least 30 minutes to walk from one side of the conference to the other.  I gave a talk at their \"Developer Zone\" which was a small stage in one of the huge buildings, with about 30 chairs lined up.  Before I was introduced there was only a few people sitting, although by the time I had introduced myself it was standing room only (and quite a few people very slowly walking past).  I recorded the presentation on a GoPro camera, which did a surprisingly good job of capturing the talk (I believe I used a separate microphone to capture the audio at a good quality).</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#london-clojurians","title":"London Clojurians","text":"<p>Clojure dojo events and presentations</p> <p>ClojureX conference</p> <p>reClojure conferece</p> <p>Article: London Clojurians - a relatively brief history</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#hack-the-tower","title":"Hack The Tower","text":"<p>Hack The Tower was a monthly practical developer event over 5 years, held in the Salesforce offices with food and drink sponsored by Salesforce (the event started in the Salesforce office of Tower 42, moving to the huge space in the Heron tower - eventually renamed to the Salesforce Tower)</p> Salesforce Tower controversy <p>There was a brief period where people were compliaining about Salesforce renaming the building after a company.</p> <p>Ironically, the original Heron tower name came from the Heron company that owned the building.</p> <p>The original office space was in Tower 42 which originally was the Nat West Tower, a bank in the UK.

Initially I encouraged the use of LightTable as the editor, as its instant feedback really helped understand if the code was correct as it was being typed.</p> <p>Once I discovered Spacemacs and added many of the Clojure specific key bindings, I created the Practicalli Spacemacs to help speed up the install setup and give people other options beyond LightTable.</p> <p>Early versions of the Practicalli books evolved from the lessons learned during these workshops.</p> <p>Hack The Tower (Hack Together London)</p> <p>Article: Hack The Tower 2013</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#clojurebridge-london","title":"ClojureBridge London","text":"<p>Organised 12 ClojureBridge London events between 2014 to 2019, introducing Clojure to over 300 women and one extremely talented young girl (accompanied by her very supportive mother).</p> <p>Approximately half of the women attending were already using a programming language to some extent for work or their own projects.

Unfortunately the follow-on interview with two developers when very poorly as they seemed to be interviewing me for a very different role.</p> <p>The developers didn't seem at all prepared and were 'trying something different' apparently.</p> <p>We started with what they called a 'pairing session' where they handed my a laptop (it was a Mac and I had not used one in a long time).  I struggled to use the mouse to click and the developers couldn't (be bothered to) explain how they had set it up.  I muddled on...</p> <p>The 'pairing' continued where I struggled to use the Mac and IntelliJ (something else I hadn't used) to try understand a code base using libraries I had never used.

It wasn't even clear how to start the application so I could see it running or run any unit tests.  The developers just stat there and watched the screen or stared at me, without answering any questions.</p> <p>By this time I was becoming quite disillusioned with the developers in front of me.  I was trying not to focus on the question of why I wanted to work with people so closed as this.</p> <p>You may have noticed that neither of the developers interviewing me were playing their part in the 'pairing' process and watched me struggle instead.  Actually one of the developers was feeling so out of their depth that they didn't really engage in any part of the interview, except to say that they were feeling out of their depth when I did ask about their role during our brief introductions.</p> <p>After 30 minutes of not 'pairing' with me, they proceeded to quiz me on obscure information about REST.  One of the developers took great pride in how much they had learned about REST, the four levels of REST and lots of other niche information.  This seemed to be the measure of how good an engineer would be, mainly because that is how his previous (and only) tech lead had worked.</p> <p>I walked out of the interview at the end with the final words that they should talk to their founder about what they are looking for, to save everyone some time.  I had no illusions that any kind of follow-up from the interview would be forth-coming.

I had attended a talk by Rick Hickey in London at SkillsMatter in 2009, but it took a while before I really understood why I would invest time in Clojure.  The language did seem quite strange compared to what I was use too.</p> <p>I was developing an interested in functional programming at that time, as the Object Oriented design approach seemed to be less appropriate for some of the data intensive systems I was trying to model.  I remembered how intriguing Haskell functional programming was from course at university and how I was starting to get a good grip of the language by the time the course ended, although more than a decade had passed since then.</p> <p>Scala was very popular at that time and I was friends with people organising the London Scala User Group.  I wanted to organise a event where we could practice the language, so started a Scala code dojo event.  Having never run such a code dojo event, I went to the London Cojurians code dojo events to see how it was done.</p> <p>After several months of going to the Clojure code dojo I woke up one day and felt I had 'got' Clojure.  I had finally found a language and community that cared about simplicity and had a language that could easily represent that simplicity.</p> <p>It took many years to get my first commercial Clojure role, but learning Clojure through the community was very rewarding.</p> <p>I started an event called Hack The Tower in the Salesforce / Heroku offices, running once a month on a Saturday. People from the Java Scala and Clojure communities were invited and I organised them into groups to the could collaborate on projects or simply learn together.  I started running an all day Clojure workshop as I discovered trying to lead others into Clojure was a great way to learn Clojure myself.  Hack The Tower ran for 5 years, until I left Salesforce (and had no office or budget anymore).</p> <p>Eventually I was accepted for a commercial Clojure role in 2017 at Citi (large international finance institute) and since then have worked for a variety of startup companies using Clojure.</p>","tags":["clojure"]},{"location":"flexiana-interview/#are-you-an-active-clojure-developer-or-a-manager","title":"Are you an active Clojure developer or a manager?","text":"<p>I have been an active Clojure engineer commercially since Citi.</p> <p>After my health was significantly impacted by Covid I felt more useful by taking an engineering manager role.

A large number of code libraries can be combined to make a complex system whist still retaining the maintainability and extensibility of the code.</p> <p>Data as a central design tool is also incredibly important.  A Data approach supports simplicity and helps break down complex requirements into simple models.  When that data is immutable, then it is really easy to reason about the behaviour of code that is transforming that data.</p> <p>And the Clojure REPL is a unique experience I have never had with other languages.

I've met many people using Clojure as their first commercial programming language.

The Clojure REPL is also a very valuable tool for creating and maintaining code, providing instant feedback and easy experimentation with code.</p> <p>A specification library (clojure.spec or Malli) can be used to validate the correct form of data, especially useful on data coming from outside the Clojure code.  Creating a specification for the important concepts and business objects in the domain ensures consistency and a simple way to validate data.</p> <p>Clojure syntax allows code to be written very cleanly and concisely.  Immutability of Clojure and a pure functional approach leads to deterministic functions, making it easy to understand exactly what a function does.</p> <p>Of course the biggest challenge in maintaining any code base is understanding why the code is there in the first place and what is its value to the organisation in keeping that code. Clojure functions, vars and namespaces all have doc-strings that explain why the code should be there.  This provides vital information to those considering maintenance and refactor of that code.</p>","tags":["neovim"]},{"location":"preparing-neovim-config-release/#health","title":"Health","text":"","tags":["neovim"]},{"location":"preparing-neovim-config-release/#brompton-upgrades","title":"Brompton upgrades","text":"<p>The Brompton folding bicycle is an excellent way to commute and although I work from home I do have some opportunities to cycling into the city.</p> <p>This weekend I am volunteering for the London Marathon, supporting those who will take longer than 8 hours to complete.

This utility will pick sane defaults\n    and is supposed to be a replacement for the simpler uses of wget.\n\n    By default, wcurl will:\n      - Percent-encode whitespaces in URLs;\n      - Download multiple URLs in parallel if the installed curl's version is &gt;= 7.66.0;\n      - Follow redirects;\n      - Automatically choose a filename as output;\n      - Avoid overwriting files if the installed curl's version is &gt;= 7.83.0 (--no-clobber);\n      - Perform retries;\n      - Set the downloaded file timestamp to the value provided by the server, if available;\n      - Disable **curl**'s URL globbing parser so {} and [] characters in URLs are not treated specially;\n      - Percent-decode the resulting filename;\n      - Use \"index.html\" as default filename if there's none in the URL.\n\n    A manpage is provided as well, check wcurl(1).\n\n    Example to download a single file:\n    $ wcurl example.com/filename.txt\n\n -- Samuel Henrique &lt;samueloph@debian.org&gt;  Sun, 30 Jun 2024 13:53:05 +0100\n\nipxe (1.21.1+git20220113.fbbdc3926+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=medium\n\n  ipxe now splits bootable images and grub scripts into a new binary\n  package: grub-ipxe.

This method is not supported by systemd\n   and certain desktop environments, which instead only change the\n   /etc/localtime symlink to point to a file in /usr/share/zoneinfo.\n\n   For this reason, starting with version 2024b-5, the tzdata package no\n   longer automatically creates the /etc/timezone file, but still updates it\n   if it exists. In a future release, support for the /etc/timezone file will\n   be completely removed. The debian-installer from Trixie also no longer\n   creates this file.\n\n   The system's timezone configuration can still be done interactively using\n   Debconf by reconfiguring the tzdata package, using 'dpkg-reconfigure\n   tzdata'. The way to programmatically read or configure the system's\n   timezone is described in /usr/share/doc/tzdata/README.Debian.\n\n -- Aurelien Jarno &lt;aurel32@debian.org&gt;  Mon, 13 Jan 2025 23:25:11 +0100\n\ngit (1:2.47.1-1) unstable; urgency=low\n\n  The git-daemon-sysvinit and git-daemon-run service configuration\n  packages have been removed, as they were security-sensitive, had\n  low usage, and were not actively maintained.

Not the fastest time (and didn't expect it), but averaged an almost respectable 21 km/hour average speed.</p> <p>I was tired after the ride on Saturday but managed a 5km park run around Normand Park in Bromley.  As usual there was a very big group (and a relatively narrow path) but I managed to jog for the first couple of minutes, occasionally on the slightly muddy grass so I wasn't boxed in by all the other runners.</p> <p>Most of the park run was a speed walking rather than jogging, but there are some slight  downhill parts where I pushed myself to run.  I was keeping up with the 38 minute pace runner and overtook them during the last 50 meter dash.  So I was a bit disappointed that my park run time was 38 minutes and 29 seconds.</p> <p>The park run was about a minute and a half faster than last time, so at least it was some improvement.  My legs weren't turning to jelly as much at the end compared to last time. I will be happy when I can get under 37 minutes before the end of March.

It\n visually resembles the C language family, but differs significantly\n in syntactic and semantic details.  Its design is oriented toward\n concerns of \"programming in the large\", that is, of creating and\n maintaining boundaries - both abstract and operational - that\n preserve large-system integrity, availability and concurrency.\n .\n It supports a mixture of imperative procedural, concurrent actor,\n object-oriented and pure functional styles.  Rust also supports\n generic programming and meta-programming, in both static and dynamic\n styles.\n .\n This package is an empty metapackage that depends on all developer tools\n in the standard rustc distribution that have been packaged for Debian.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>apt install rust-all\nInstalling:\n  rust-all\n\nInstalling dependencies:\n  cargo           gdb           libbabeltrace1          libclang-cpp19      libdebuginfod-common  libhttp-parser2.9  libobjc4                    libsource-highlight4t64  libstdc++-14-dev  lld-19       llvm-19-linker-tools  python3-pygments  rust-clippy  rustc\n  clang-19        lib32gcc-s1   libc6-i386              libclang-rt-19-dev  libdebuginfod1t64     libipt2            libpfm4                     libstd-rust-1.85         libxml2-dev       llvm-19      llvm-19-runtime       python3-yaml      rust-gdb     rustfmt\n  clang-tools-19  lib32stdc++6  libclang-common-19-dev  libclang1-19        libgit2-1.9           libobjc-14-dev     libsource-highlight-common  libstd-rust-dev          libz3-dev         llvm-19-dev  llvm-19-tools         rust-analyzer     rust-llvm\n\nSuggested packages:\n  cargo-doc  clang-19-doc  wasi-libc  gdb-doc  gdbserver  libc-dbg  libstdc++-14-doc  llvm-19-doc  python-pygments-doc  rust-doc  rust-src  libstd-rust-dev-wasm32\n\nSummary:\n  Upgrading: 0, Installing: 42, Removing: 0, Not Upgrading: 12\n  Download size: 196 MB\n  Space needed: 1,100 MB / 942 GB available\n</code></pre> <p>Hold on...

Code has become king, but for my its a side effect of a lot of non-coding work.</p> <p>When I was first looking at a role in software development, people were referred to as Systems Analysits or simply Analysts.</p> <p>What is a product manager? A person that takes the needs of the software, defines what that should look like and checks at the end that the solution does what its supposed to do.</p> <p>This is a role that engineers used to do as well.</p> <p>Example: Joel was a T-shaped person (generalising specialist) who would do that product management but they would also build a prototype that explored the problem space and highlight technical challenges (performance, scalability, etc.)</p> <p>Example: Markus was first a signal controller and then a manager for train signal controllers at National Rail. Self-taught how to create an app and created a very useful app for signal controllers.  National Rail then asked Markus to be in charge of all apps and used there curiosity to ensure the apps did what the customers want them to do.</p> <p>Challenge: take your existing product managers and teach them UI design skills and/or software engineering skills.  Product Managers ++ (plus plus).</p> <p>AI can be valuable for prototyping ideas, which can be used by exiting non-technical product management.</p> <p>Summary: Squirrel is suggesting product owners / managers do more than create documents.  Using prompt engineering they can create prototypes that should give more insight into what a feature or product should do and even highlight some of the technical challenges in building such a feature.</p> <p>This kind of prototyping is what I encourage the engineers I work with to do (or occasionally do myself), before we all get overly invested into the feature and all its intricacies.</p>","tags":["clojure","neovim","markdown","squirrel-squadron"]},{"location":"organising-practicalli-boards/#clojure","title":"Clojure","text":"<p>I have been cleaning up my 'apps' on Replit and deleting anything outdated.</p> <p>NOTE: I had created more apps in the past that the free plan of Replit, so the free plan is less generous than it used to be.</p> <p>A nice functional example of fizzbuzz game in Clojure.</p> <pre><code>(ns main)\n\n(defn fizzbuzz\n  [size]\n  (clojure.pprint/pprint\n    (map vector\n      (range size)\n      (cycle [:fizz :_ :_])\n      (cycle [:buzz :_ :_ :_ :_]))))\n\n(fizzbuzz 15)\n</code></pre> <p>Palendrome example</p> <pre><code>;; Inspired by https://porkostomus.gitlab.io/posts-output/2018-08-16-Just-Juxt-2/\n\n(ns justjuxt.palindromes)\n\n;; Version from the original post.\n;; Traverses the second half of palindromic strings unnecessarily (see my comments on the post).\n;; Also misses that empty string is a palindrome.\n(defn porkostomus-palindrome?

The Library repositories keyword, <code>:mvn/repos</code>, is already qualified, so this redesign brings the aliases in line with that style.  The alias keywords are prepended with names to communicate the category of purpose for each alias, e.g. repl, project, env, lib, inspect, build, deploy.</p> <p>As part of the redesign, the new flags introduced with Clojure CLI tools, <code>-M</code> and <code>-X</code>, are used.  The <code>-X</code> flag is the preferred Clojure command line flag to use for the aliases, where the library supports executing a function from the library that takes a hash-map of arguments.  Otherwise <code>-M</code> flag replaces <code>-A</code> flag and continues to use <code>clojure.main</code> to call the <code>-main</code> function of the given main namespace.</p> <p>Add project/check to give detailed report on compilation issues for a project</p> <p>UPDATE: all aliases in Practicalli CLI Config use fully qualified names.</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-project-update-2/#practicalli-spacemacs","title":"Practicalli Spacemacs","text":"<p>Resolved simple bug fixes raised by the community.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p> Practical.li Website</p> <p> Practical.li GitHub Org  practicalli-johnny profile</p> <p> @practicalli@clj.social  @practical_li</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-project-update-3/","title":"Practicalli Project Update 3","text":"<p>Continuing the Live broadcasts covering the developmment of the Banking on Clojure web application. - 084 - Banking On Clojure - Part5 - Generated database records from clojure.spec - 085 - Banking On Clojure - Part6 - Refactor database schema, specs and namespaces</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-project-update-3/#practicalli-clojure","title":"Practicalli Clojure","text":"<p>New sections and Pages: * Coding Challenges section * Unit testing fixtures</p> <p>Added Code Challenges section, covering the Clojure challenges available in 4Clojure.com, Exercism.io, CodwWars.com, ClojureScript Koans and Advent of Code.</p> <p>A quick guide to using each of the Code challenge websites was provided and tips to using them effectively.</p> <p>GitHub code repositories for the Practicalli 4Clojure guides, codewars-guides and exercism-guides were included, along with the 4Clojure guides video playlist which walks through the solution to over 60 challenges and different approaches to solving them.</p> <p>Several 4Clojure and Exercism challenges have been added as solution walk-through, showing the design thinking behind the solution in the website.
