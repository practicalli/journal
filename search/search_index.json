There was a limited understanding of job opportunities using Haskel, certainly compared to Java and Scala.</p> <p>I volunteered to start running a practical community event to practice Scala together.  I attended the Python and Clojure dojo events to see how to run an event for Scala.</p> <p>After finding a company willing to host (and more importantly provide pizza and drinks) I started running a monthly Scala dojo.</p> <p>I kept going to the Clojure dojo as it was a very welcoming group and I was also facinated and highly confused by the language itself.</p> <p>During the first year of Clojure dojo events I slowly became very attached to the simplicity of solutions that could be created with language (even though I did strugle to understand the language as I wasnt dedicating enough time to learn it).</p> <p>I was also attracted by the thought of using Emacs for development, an editor that felt less complicated and heavyweight compared to IntelliJ used by most people for Java and Scala.</p> <p>Startup &amp; compilation speed challenges</p> <p>IntelliJ has a very powerful indexing capability, however, for Scala it was indexing Java and Scala standard libraries which did add a few minutes when starting a projects.</p> <p>The Scala compiler in its early days did take some time to complete.  As all the code was required to compile before running, then the feedback time during development was a bit of a constraint.</p> <p>Tooling optomisations and faster laptops did make things better during the first year, although still in a different time frame compared to the instant feedback with Clojure.</p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#conference-talks","title":"Conference talks","text":"<p>To focus my efforts to learn Clojure and share my enthusiasm, I started submitting talk proposals for conferences.  An additional benefit was to go to the conferences for free.</p> <p>JAX London accepted my first Clojure talk proposal.  I was very nervous giving the first talk and was still struggling to explain some of the concepts.  However, the audience was very supportive in general.</p> <p>One person sat right at the front of the audience started to heckle me half way through.  They wanted 'real world' examples of Clojure even though the talk was advertised as a simple introduction.  Out of frustration I replied, \"this isnt the real world, its JAX London\".  The audience laught out quite loudly, exept for the heckler who I think became more annoyed.</p> <p>I learned a lot about what I didnt understand about Clojure and undeterred I worked on creating better talks.</p> <p>I was hired by Atlassian as an Enginner and product ambassador (developer relations) which gave me a chance to present talks at conferences all over Europe.</p> <p>The talk I enjoyed the most was at JavaDays in Sofia, Bulgaria.  I had moved away from slides and simply walked through live code examples, evaluating the code so the audience could see the REPL workflow as well as seeing the code in action.</p> <p>Working at Salesforce I was also encouraged to submit talks to conferences (as well as present with other community members at Salesforce specific events).  I would submit talks and workshops on Salesforce and Clojure topics to double the chance of being accepted.  Almost all conferences accepted Clojure talks over the Salesforce talks, although CodeMotion Rome did accept a Salesforce workshop as well as a Clojure talk.</p> <p>The most sureal environment I gave a Clojure talk at was CeBit, a huge conference in Hanover, Germany.  The conference is so huge it is spread over 18 aircraft hanger sized buildings and there are busses to shuttle people around the conference as it takes at least 30 minutes to walk from one side of the conference to the other.  I gave a talk at their \"Developer Zone\" which was a small stage in one of the huge buildings, with about 30 chairs lined up.  Before I was introduced there was only a few people sitting, although by the time I had introduced myself it was standing room only (and quite a few people very slowly walking past).  I recorded the presentation on a GoPro camera, which did a surprisingly good job of capturing the talk (I believe I used a separate microphone to capture the audio at a good quality).</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#london-clojurians","title":"London Clojurians","text":"<p>Clojure dojo events and presentations</p> <p>ClojureX conference</p> <p>reClojure conferece</p> <p>Article: London Clojurians - a relatively brief history </p>"},{"location":"practicalli-team/#hack-the-tower","title":"Hack The Tower","text":"<p>Hack The Tower was a monthly practical developer event over 5 years, held in the Salesforce offices with food and drink sponsored by Salesforce (the event started in the Salesforce office of Tower 42, moving to the huge space in the Heron tower - eventually renamed to the Salesforce Tower)</p> Salesforce Tower controversy <p>There was a brief period where people were compliaining about Salesforce renaming the building after a company.</p> <p>Ironically, the original Heron tower name came from the Heron company that owned the building.</p> <p>The original office space was in Tower 42 which originally was the Nat West Tower, a bank in the UK.

The <code>-X</code> flag for executing a function with EDN arguments (hash-map arguments) has already been introduced and the new release depreciates the generic <code>-A</code> alias in favor of <code>-M</code>.  In the long term using the <code>-X</code> flag with functions that take a structured argument looks to be an excellent approach.</p> <p>Started a redesign of practicalli/clojure-deps-edn using qualified keywords for alias names.  The Library repositories keyword, <code>:mvn/repos</code>, is already qualified, so this redesign brings the aliases in line with that style.  The alias keywords are prepended with names to communicate the category of purpose for each alias, e.g. repl, project, env, lib, inspect, build, deploy.</p> <p>As part of the redesign, the new flags introduced with Clojure CLI tools, <code>-M</code> and <code>-X</code>, are used.  The <code>-X</code> flag is the preferred Clojure command line flag to use for the aliases, where the library supports executing a function from the library that takes a hash-map of arguments.  Otherwise <code>-M</code> flag replaces <code>-A</code> flag and continues to use <code>clojure.main</code> to call the <code>-main</code> function of the given main namespace.</p> <p>Add project/check to give detailed report on compilation issues for a project</p>"},{"location":"2020/09/15/practicalli-project-update-2/#practicalli-spacemacs","title":"Practicalli Spacemacs","text":"<p>Resolved simple bug fixes raised by the community.</p>"},{"location":"2020/09/30/practicalli-project-update-3/","title":"Practicalli Project Update 3","text":"<p>Continuing the Live broadcasts covering the developmment of the Banking on Clojure web application. - 084 - Banking On Clojure - Part5 - Generated database records from clojure.spec - 085 - Banking On Clojure - Part6 - Refactor database schema, specs and namespaces</p>"},{"location":"2020/09/30/practicalli-project-update-3/#practicalli-clojure","title":"Practicalli Clojure","text":"<p>New sections and Pages: * Coding Challenges section * Unit testing fixtures</p> <p>Added Code Challenges section, covering the Clojure challenges available in 4Clojure.com, Exercism.io, CodwWars.com, ClojureScript Koans and Advent of Code.  </p> <p>A quick guide to using each of the Code challenge websites was provided and tips to using them effectively.  </p> <p>GitHub code repositories for the Practicalli 4Clojure guides, codewars-guides and exercism-guides were included, along with the 4Clojure guides video playlist which walks through the solution to over 60 challenges and different approaches to solving them. </p> <p>Several 4Clojure and Exercism challenges have been added as solution walk-through, showing the design thinking behind the solution in the website.
